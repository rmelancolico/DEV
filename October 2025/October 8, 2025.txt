Jeremiah 31, Luke 8, Acts 12, Proverbs 8


RHEMA: Luke 8:5 NIV
“A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up.

Why did the farmer allowed that some seed will fell along the path, in rocky ground and some along the thorns? Dili siya sayangan? Not at all, When a farmer scatter seeds, he has confident on his work for three reasons: one, he has alot of seeds to scatter; two, he has confident that he have a bountiful harvest; and lastly, he is a hardworking farmer

1. When seeding, always be ready of your resources. Dont be scared to scatter seeds as many as you can. Our God will provide seeds  to plant
2. Build up your confident that the seed will yeild you a bountifull harvest. The bigger your faith the bigger your  confident
3. Your work will not stop on just scattering. You need to grow them, take care of them. In other words, you are accountable to it
