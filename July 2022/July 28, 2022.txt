Job 11, Psalm 105, Proverbs 28, 2 Corinthians 1


M: 2 Corinthians 1:3-4 GNT
Let us give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the merciful Father, the God from whom all help comes! He helps us in all our troubles, so that we are able to help others who have all kinds of troubles, using the same help that we ourselves have received from God.


C Job 11:13-:14 GNT
Put your heart right, Job. Reach out to God. Put away evil and wrong from your home.


P: Job 11:16-18 GNT
Then all your troubles will fade from your memory, like floods that are past and remembered no more. Your life will be brighter than sunshine at noon, and life's darkest hours will shine like the dawn. You will live secure and full of hope; God will protect you and give you rest.


W: Proverbs 28:13 GNT
You will never succeed in life if you try to hide your sins. Confess them and give them up; then God will show mercy to you.


A: I will put my heart at Jesus!
