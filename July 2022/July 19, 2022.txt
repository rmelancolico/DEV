Job 2, Psalm 96, Proverbs 19, Matthew 25


M: Job 2:10 GNT
Job answered, “You are talking nonsense! When God sends us something good, we welcome it. How can we complain when he sends us trouble?” Even in all this suffering Job said nothing against God.


C: Psalm 96:1-3 GNT

Sing a new song to the Lord! Sing to the Lord, all the world! Sing to the Lord, and praise him! Proclaim every day the good news that he has saved us. Proclaim his glory to the nations, his mighty deeds to all peoples.


P: Matthew 25:40 GNT

The King will reply, ‘I tell you, whenever you did this for one of the least important of these followers of mine, you did it for me!’



W: Matthew 25:45-46 GNT

The King will reply, ‘I tell you, whenever you refused to help one of these least important ones, you refused to help me.’ These, then, will be sent off to eternal punishment, but the righteous will go to eternal life.”



A: whatever situation i am in, i will always be faithful to God
