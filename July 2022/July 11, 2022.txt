Esther 4, Psalm 88, Proverbs 11, Matthew 17

M: Matthew 17:20 GNT
“It was because you do not have enough faith,” answered Jesus. “I assure you that if you have faith as big as a mustard seed, you can say to this hill, ‘Go from here to there!’ and it will go. You could do anything!”

C: Proverbs 11:12 GNT
It is foolish to speak scornfully of others. If you are smart, you will keep quiet.

P: Prov 11:31 GNT

Those who are good are rewarded here on earth, so you can be sure that wicked and sinful people will be punished.

W: Esther 4:14 GNT
If you keep quiet at a time like this, help will come from heaven to the Jews, and they will be saved, but you will die and your father's family will come to an end. Yet who knows—maybe it was for a time like this that you were made queen!”

A: Lord increase my faith. I want to always depend on You
