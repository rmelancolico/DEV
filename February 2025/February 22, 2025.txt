REFLECTION:
i have experience true change. I have faith that I am change from the inside. and with that, i will show from the outside. Meaning, what inside me will be spoken out. What i have spoken out will be my pratice. I will preach from my heart, and act on what i have preach. My preaching will be only true if i myself is doing it. It is by my example that my preaching has power!
