For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.”


C: Romans 1:5 NIV
Through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith for his name’s sake.

Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done.
