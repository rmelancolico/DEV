Exodus 25, Isaiah 25, Romans 4, Acts 25


RHEMA: Romans 4:20-21 NIV
Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.


P: Romans 4:7-8 NIV
“Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord will never count against them.”


W: Romans 4:14-15 NIV
For if those who depend on the law are heirs, faith means nothing and the promise is worthless, because the law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.



REFLECTION:

God has promise me disciples (200 leaders with their family, 1 Chronicles 12:32)! i will not waver, i will not let allow unbelief in my heart
