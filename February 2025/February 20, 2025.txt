REFLECTIONS

Start of John 21, Peter have decided to go out to fish. His statement was "I am going out to fish". Pag ingon niya na I am, meaning he intended to go fishing alone. Alone, without Christ. Sometimes sa atong life, when we experience pain or lost, we tend to go back to the things that are simplier for us. For Peter it was fishing. It was his comfort. same to us, some times we go back to the things that we are comfortable with, mga butang na nakasanayan na nato sa una. But When Jesus is involve, lahi ra ang resulta, dili lng ma secure ang atong present (naka catch sila ug mga fish, 153 pcs), pati ang atong future na kauban si Jesus secure pd (when they arrive at shore and see's a fire of burning coals with fish and bread). Dili lng fish ang naa sa atong future, with bread pa
