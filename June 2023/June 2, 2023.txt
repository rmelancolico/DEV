Hosea 13, Joshua 8, Matthew 10, 1 Peter 4

RHEMA: Matthew 10:29-31 NIV
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.


W:NIV Hosea 13:6
When I fed them, they were satisfied; when they were satisfied, they became proud; then they forgot me.

REFLECTION:
I am worth more than two sparrows. Sa panahon karon na financially challenge ko, ipa dako nako ang akong faith dya sa Ginoo. I will do my God given purpose with excellence. My financial challenge will not be a reason not to do my God given purpose. Mag P.I.C. ko!
