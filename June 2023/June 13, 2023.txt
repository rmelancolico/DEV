Amos 4, Joshua 16, Matthew 18, 1 John 4


RHEMA: Matthew 18:3-5 NIV
And he said: “Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.




W: Matthew 18:6 NIV
“If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.



REFLECTION:
What does it means when Jesus said, 'become like a little children'? This means that like a child who is dependent to their parents, so I should be dependent to God. Little children does not worry what to eat, what to wear, for they know that their parents will be providing them all they needs.
And also, a new believer is also like a little children, dili pa sila kabalo unsaon pagkinabuhi dya sa presencya sa Ginoo. and as a leader, i should be able to guide them and provide for their spiritual growth
