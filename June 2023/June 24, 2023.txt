Jonah 4, Judges 2, Matthew 28, Revelation 6


RHEMA: Judges 2:10 NIV
After that whole generation had been gathered to their ancestors, another generation grew up who knew neither the Lord nor what he had done for Israel.




C: Matthew 28:19-20 NIV
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”



REFLECTION:
My next generation will know the power and the greatness of God. I will prepare my next generation in service. I will involve them.
