Micah 3, Judges 5, Mark 3, Revelation 9


RHEMA: Mark 3:7-8 NIV
Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed. When they heard about all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon.


REFLECTION:
Dili na lisod mangita ug disciples kung mag manifist na ang Holy Spirit sa akong life.
- dapat mag go depper ko sa Holy Spirit
- focus on the power of Holy Spirit
- dont doubt the Holy Spirit
