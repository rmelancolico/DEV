Amos 6, Joshua 18, Matthew 20, 2 John 1


RHEMA: Joshua 18:3-4 NIV
So Joshua said to the Israelites: “How long will you wait before you begin to take possession of the land that the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has given you? Appoint three men from each tribe. I will send them out to make a survey of the land and to write a description of it, according to the inheritance of each. Then they will return to me.



REFLECTION:
I will not anymore wait to take possession. I will develop my PJJ. I will do all of my best to meet my PJJ. Continues follow up thru PIC and chats/text. I will enhance my connection with them
