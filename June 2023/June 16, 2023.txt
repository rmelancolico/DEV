Amos 7, Joshua 19, Matthew 21, 3 John 1


RHEMA: Matthew 21:21-22 NIV
Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”


REFLECTION:
It is by faith that I will bear fruits! It is by prayer that I will find disciples. Ipalalom nako ang akong pag too. Himoon nako more intentional ang pag pray sa list of 12 nako. Mag concentrate ko sa akong PJJ and also i pray na e reveal ni Lord sa ako kinsa ang Iyang gpang entrust. ALso, I will pray for knowledge and wisdom para ma preserve nako ang harvest
