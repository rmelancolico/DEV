Micah 2, Judges 4, Mark 2, Revelation 8


RHEMA: Mark 2:21-22 NIV
“No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse. And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins.”



REFLECTION:
Sayang ang new life kung ipadayon nako ang old habbits. Mawa.on nako ang mga old habbits nako na:

- Tapolan
- cgig unya unya
- dali ra ma distract
- dili maka focus

I will improve my new habbits
- maningkamot ug maning tiil
- self control para dili dali ma distract
- keep the focus
