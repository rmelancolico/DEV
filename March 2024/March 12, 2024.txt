REFLECTION:
Burning desire to know the Word of God. Dapat sa pag basa nako sa scripture naa dapat ang desire na mag kalayo pa ko even more. Dili ko mosugot na wala koy ma kuha na revelation every time na mag devo ko. Kung needed na basahon ang chapter more than once para ma open jd ang akong mind, ma on fire ang akong kasing kasing. Always nako e mind set na ginabuhat nako ang tanan tungod sa gugma nako sa Ginoo
