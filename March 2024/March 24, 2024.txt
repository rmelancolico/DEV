REFLECTION:

Jesus wants me to be well, not just physically but also in every aspect of my life, financial, family relationship, ministry and communion with the Holy Spirit. To do  that, i need to get up and pick my mat and walk. Dapat naa jd makit.an sa akong action. Dapat e gusto pd nako ang gusto ni Lord sa ako life.

1. I will do excellent in my work - no more mañana habits.
2. The key to my ministry is my communion with the Holy Spirit - never neglect my secret place
