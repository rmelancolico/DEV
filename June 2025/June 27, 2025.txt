Isaiah 38, 1 Corinthians 2,  Acts 9, Proverbs 27

1 Corinthians 2:12 NIV
What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us.


The importance of the Holy Spirit

1. Reveals God's purpose in us
2. Reveals opportunity to serve God
3. Reveals the responsibility of our freedom

God will reveal many things in our life. And we need the Holy Spirit to be able to see all of this things. When we serve God, many doors will be open before us. But we need the Holy Spirit for us to distinguish which are from God and which are not.

Warning: Proverbs 27:1
Do not boast about tomorrow,
    for you do not know what a day may bring.
