RHEMA:

Isaiah 30:1 
“Woe to the obstinate children,”
    declares the Lord,
“to those who carry out plans that are not mine,
    forming an alliance, but not by my Spirit,
    heaping sin upon sin;

- God first principle is none negotiable. Aligning my plan with the plan of the Lord. 
- form alliance with the same principle. Disciple of the same Spirit, advance the Kingdom together


Acts 1:4-5 NIV
On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”

- In doing my God given purpose, it will be draining (in all aspect) and challenging. But when guided with the Holy Spirit nothing will be hard. Communion with the Holy Spirit will bring refreshment to the sould and to the body

Formula for successful discipleship
