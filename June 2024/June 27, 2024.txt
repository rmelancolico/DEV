2 Samuel 5, 1 Corinthians 2, Proverbs 27


RHEMA: 1 Corinthians 2:4-5
My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power, so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God’s power.


C: Proverbs 27:11 NIV
Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart; then I can answer anyone who treats me with contempt.



P:  1 Corinthians 2:9 However, as it is written: “What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what no human mind has conceived” the things God has prepared for those who love him



W: Proverbs 27:1 NIV
Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.


REFLECTION:
Every time that share the gospel, i will share it with the demonstration of the power of the Holy Spirit and not with my own
