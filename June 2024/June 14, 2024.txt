1 Samuel 30, Matthew 23, Romans 13, Proverbs 14


RHEMA: Romans 13:11-12 NIV
And do this, understanding the present time: The hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.


C: Romans 13:13-14 NIV
Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh.


P: Proverbs 14:4 NIV
Where there are no oxen, the manger is empty, but from the strength of an ox come abundant harvests.


W: Matthew 23:12 NIV
For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.



REFLECTION:
Its time to really wake up from my slumber. I will really do my duty that God has put me in. i will put more effort in believing and going..
