1 Samuel 22, Matthew 15, Romans 5, Proverbs 9


RHEMA: Matthew 15:32 NIV
Jesus called his disciples to him and said, “I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way.”



C: Proverbs 9:6 NIV
Leave your simple ways and you will live; walk in the way of insight.”



P: Romans 5:3-5 NIV
Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.



W: Proverbs 9:8 NIV
Do not rebuke mockers or they will hate you; rebuke the wise and they will love you.



REFLECTION:
Jesus dont want His people to experience spiritual collapse. He will use me to prevent this. At this Jesus show compassion to the people who was with Him, He then ask His disciple "How many loaves do you have". This is also means, what do yo have? So Jesus is now asking me, what do i have to prevent spiritual collapse for His people? I will offer my programming skills to Jesus, so that He can use this. I will offer my little life to Jesus, so that He could multiply this to help others
