You, however, are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you.

But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit gives life because of righteousness.

REFLECTION:
The Spirit of God live in me. I will not lost hope with my current situation (my health). I will live a full life. I will see my 200 leaders with their family. I apply the blood of Jesus in my health, i cancel the spirit of un healthy body, the pain i am feeling has been redeemed through the blood of Jesus. I apply the blood of Jesus over my head and cancel all overthinking regarding my health. I will focus my thinking in preserving the harvest.
