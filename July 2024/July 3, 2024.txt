REFLECTION:
Abandoning selfish ambition for God's glory. I fully commit to my duty as a child of God. Its now not all about what i will become, but it will all about how many leaders i can raise in my life time. Raising leaders will be my new addiction. I will raise at least 2 leaders for this year.
