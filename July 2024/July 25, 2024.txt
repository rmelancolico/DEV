Luke 1, Acts 21, Psalms 21, Proverbs 23


RHEMA: Luke 1:76-79 NIV
And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him, to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace.”



C: Proverbs 23:12 NIV
Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge.


P: Luke 1:37 NIV
For no word from God will ever fail.”


W: Proverbs 23:4-5 NIV
Do not wear yourself out to get rich; do not trust your own cleverness. Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone, for they will surely sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle.



REFLECTION:
Jesus is coming and I am called to prepare His way. I will prepare my leaders for work in the harvest field
