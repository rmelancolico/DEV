John 15, Acts 15, Psalms 15, Proverbs 15


RHEMA: John 15:4-5 NIV

Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.


C: John 15:10 NIV
If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commands and remain in his love


P: John 15:7 NIV
If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.


W: John 15:6 NIV
If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.


REFLECTION:

Apart from Jesus I am nothing. Fruitfulness will only happen if I continue to live in His presence. I will always remind myself that whatever situation I am in, i will always go back to the source. In happiness or sadness, i will always give thanks to God. I will make Him bigger than me, the bigger the branch the better the fruits.
Increase gratitude
