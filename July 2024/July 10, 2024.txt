John 10, Acts 10, Psalms 10, Proverbs 10


RHEMA: John 10:11-13 NIV
“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.



C: John 10:38 NIV
But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, <u>believe the works</u>, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.”



P: Prov 10:22 NIV
The blessing of the Lord brings wealth, without painful toil for it.




W: John 10:10 NIV
The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.



REFLECTION:
I will be a good shepherd. I will not abandon the flocks that God will intrust me. I am responsible for my flock. I will always check their condition. I know gamay pa ni sila, pero dri ko mag sugod! Ipakita nako sa masaligan ko sa ginagmay.
