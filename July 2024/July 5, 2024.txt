REFLECTION:
My Father is always at work! This season will be the start of my busy work load as a child of God. Maningkamot ko na mag increase ang akong simbalay. Pangitaan nako ug pama agi na makakuha ug mag bantay sa akong anak every sunday para dili ko mag lisod ug ma focus nako ang akong time sa mga simbalay nako ug maka believe and go ko.
