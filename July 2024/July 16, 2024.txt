John 16, Acts 16, Psalms 16, Proverbs 16


M: John 16:23-24
In that day you will no longer ask me anything. I tell you the truth, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.

P: John 16:20 I tell you the truth, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.

Acts 16:31
They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.”

W: Proverbs 16:5
The Lord detests all the proud of heart. Be sure of this: They will not go unpunished.

Reflection:
I will ask to my Father in Jesus name:

1. Increase compassion
2. Increasing faith
3. Strength to work at the harvest fields
4. Knowledge and wisdom to preserve the harvest
