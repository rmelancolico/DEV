John 6, Acts 6, Psalms 6, Proverbs 6


RHEMA: John 6:63 NIV
The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life.


Acts 6:10 NIV
But they could not stand up against the wisdom the Spirit gave him as he spoke.


C: John 6:27 NIV
Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.”



P: Proverbs 6:20-22 NIV
My son, keep your father’s command and do not forsake your mother’s teaching. Bind them always on your heart; fasten them around your neck. When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you.



W: Proverbs 6:9-11 NIV
How long will you lie there, you sluggard? When will you get up from your sleep? A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest— and poverty will come on you like a thief and scarcity like an armed man.



REFLECTION:
It is by the Spirit and not by our own intellect. Sa pag lead nako sa simbalay nako ugma, dili ko mahimong effective kung saligan lng nako ang akong kaugalingon na kalaman. The Holy Spirit will flow through me, and will use me as a vessel to glorify God. But this does not mean na dili nako mag prepare. I will come prepare in my simbalay. I am confident that i can speak boldly tomorrow, because He enables me and He will be glorified, not me, but Him be all the glory now and forever.
