RHEMA: Acts 19:8
Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God.


C: Proverbs 20:18 
Plans are established by seeking advice; so if you wage war, obtain guidance.


P: Psalm 19:9-11
The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever. The decrees of the Lord are firm, and all of them are righteous. They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the honeycomb. By them your servant is warned; in keeping them there is great reward.


W: Proverbs 20:13
Do not love sleep or you will grow poor; stay awake and you will have food to spare.


REFLECTION:
To speak boldly and persuasively. Dapat dili ko ma hadlok, dili ko mag duha duha na mag speak sa simbalay nako. And dapat with persuasive, dapat naay power. Ug dapat ma bless sila.
