John 4, Acts 4, Psalms 4, Proverbs 4


RHEMA: Acts 4:31 NIV
After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.



C: John 4:24 NIV
God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.”



P: Psalms 4:5-6 NIV
Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or turn away from them. Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will watch over you.




W: John 4:38 NIV
I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.”



REFLECTION:
Pray until something happens. Prayer is very important for this season. Ma useless ang pag fasting nako if e taken for granted nako ang prayer. I will not relapse in my prayer. I need to pray more hangtod ang mga distraction ma shaken off, para wala na mag distract sa ako to speak God Words boldly. I will go deeper in my prayer time ( 10am, and 1:30pm), 5 mins of praying in tongues. I will memorize the prayer points and pray for it with all my heart and soul.
