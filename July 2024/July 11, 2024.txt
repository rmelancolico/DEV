REFLECTION:
Obeying God's command rather than people's opinion. People are in titled with their own opinion. But it doesn't really matters what they say. When God calls you to be a vessel for a persons new life, focus on the on it. Dont mind what will other say, or what others would say about this person. When God commanded you to set a person free, then go and believe.
