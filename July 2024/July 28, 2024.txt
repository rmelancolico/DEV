RHEMA: Luke 3:4-6 NIV
As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: “A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him. Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth. And all people will see God’s salvation.’”



C: Acts 23:11 NIV
The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, “Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.”



P: Psalms 23:2-3 NIV
He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters,     he refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his name’s sake.



W: Luke 3:9 NIV
The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”


REFLECTION:

This is my duty!

Straigh path = Tanan na mga rason, tul.eron. Tanan na mga sayop na binuhatan
valley shall be filled in = tanan ka kulangon (financial, faith) pun,an
every mountain and hill made low = walaon ang ka kapoy sa pag buhat para sa Ginoo
