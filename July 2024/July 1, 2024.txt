John 1, Acts 1, Psalms 1, Proverbs 1



RHEMA: John 1:3-5 NIV
Through Him all things were made; without Him nothing was made that has been made. In Him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.


C: Proverbs 1:23 NIV
Repent at my rebuke! Then I will pour out my thoughts to you, I will make known to you my teachings.


P: Psalms 1:1-3 NIV
Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night. That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not witherâ€” whatever they do prospers.


W: Proverbs 1:32 NIV
For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them;


REFLECTION:
The intensity of my light will depends on my intimacy with the Holy Spirit. Useless ang kaisug nako na mo adto sa kangitngit (battle) para mahayagan ang mga tao didto kung kandila lng na tag singko ang akong dala. Dapat flood light ang dala nako, para daghan ko mahayagan. As a light of the world, i need to level up my intimacy with the Holy Spirit. Spend more time on prayers! More memory verse to memorize. Always display active and genuine faith.
