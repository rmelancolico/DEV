P: Mark 13:11 NIV
Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.


W: Mark 13:35-37 NIV
“Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back—whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn. If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping. What I say to you, I say to everyone: ‘Watch!’”



REFLECTION: 
I will not worry, God is true to His promises. I need to stay focus, stay on the agenda that I am bringing, Keep on inviting. Mamunga ra lagi ko.
