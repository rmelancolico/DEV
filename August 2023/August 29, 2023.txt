REFLECTION:
A day will come na tanan na ko gipang invite mo uban ra sa ako, sila na mismo mangutana. I was made to deliver others, kung mo undang ko, dili sila ma deliver.

1. continue inviting people
2. strength my invitation skills
3. strengthen self, para dili dali masakitan kung e turn down
4. padayon lng
