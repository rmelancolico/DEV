Zechariah 6, Proverbs 22, Luke 6

RHEMA: Luke 6:43-44 NIV
“No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers.


C: Proverbs 22:29 NIV
Do you see someone skilled in their work? They will serve before kings; they will not serve before officials of low rank.


P: Zechariah 6:15 NIV
Those who are far away will come and help to build the temple of the Lord, and you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the Lord your God.”


REFLECTION:
I will be a good tree. Dapat ang akong roots naka deep jd sa mga basic life style namo. Mo padayon ko ug sipsip sa nutritients na hatag sa akong leader sa ako. Dili ma sayang ang pag fertilize sa akong leader sa ako.
