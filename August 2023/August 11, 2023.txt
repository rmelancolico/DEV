Haggai 2, [Judges 19, Mark 17, Revelation 22]


RHEMA: Haggai 2:4 NIV
But now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ declares the Lord. ‘Be strong, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,’ declares the Lord, ‘and work. For I am with you,’ declares the Lord Almighty.


REFLECTION:
I will work hard in my ministry, in my marketplace and in my health.

I will keep on inviting people
I will keep my focus sa akong marketplace, dili ko mag padala sa emotion
I will eat healthy
