Habakkuk 3, Judges 14, Mark 12, Revelation 17


RHEMA: Habakkuk 3:18-19 NIV
yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will be joyful in God my Savior. The Sovereign Lord is my strength; he makes my feet like the feet of a deer, he enables me to tread on the heights. For the director of music. On my stringed instruments.


C: Mark 12:17 NIV
Then Jesus said to them, “Give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s and to God what is God’s.” And they were amazed at him.


REFLECTION:
Whatever situation I am, I will rejoice in the Lord. Bahala unsay mahatabo, unsay man ang akong gina atubang mag padayon ko ug buhat sa akong God given purpose. Kay ang tinoud na kalipay naa sa pag buhat sa God given purpose
