REFLECTION:
To always pray and never give up. Dapat mahimo ko persistent sa akong prayer life. Dili dapat mo baba ang akong prayer life, e level up nako always. Even though ma reject ko sa pag invite or ipaasa ko sa akong invites, dili ko mag stop na mag pray para sa ila. Ipadayon lng dyapun nako ang pagpray sa ila. Balik balikan dyapun nako sila ug invite, hangtod mag reply pa. kung dili na mag reply, ipadayon lng dyapun sa pag ampo sa ila.
