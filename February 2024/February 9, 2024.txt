Judges 5, Luke 8, Acts 1,  Proverbs 9


RHEMA: Luke 8:5-8 NIV
“A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up. Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.” When he said this, he called out, “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”


C: Acts 1:8 NIV
But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”



P: Proverbs 9:6 NIV
Leave your simple ways and you will live; walk in the way of insight.”



W: Luke 8:25 NIV
<u>“Where is your faith?”</u> he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another, “Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.”




REFLECTION:

Dili ko mag undang ug pugas sa seed na g entrust sa ako from God. Dili pd ko ma discourage if naay mawala na mga gpang tamnan nako, or dugay sila mag mature. Once na sow na nako ang seeds, dili ni nako sila pabayaan. Even pd katong na tanom sa gawas sa fertile soil, mangita ko ug ways na ma transfer nako sila. mag level up ang akong consolidation skills, para katong na tamnan dili ma sayang..
