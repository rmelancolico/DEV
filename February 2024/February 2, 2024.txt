Joshua 23, Matthew 23, Luke 2, Proverbs 2


RHEMA: Matthew 23:23 NIV
“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.


C: Joshua 23:6 NIV
“Be very strong; be careful to obey all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, without turning aside to the right or to the left.


P: Proverbs 2:6-7 NIV
For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. He holds success in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,


W: Joshua 23:15 NIV
But just as all the good things the Lord your God has promised you have come to you, so he will bring on you all the evil things he has threatened, until the Lord your God has destroyed you from this good land he has given you.



REFLECTION:
Giving tithes is not enough. As a christian, cherry-picking commands is a bad idea. Every command of God is important. I need to practice them all.

1. Ask Holy Spirit guidance to be more faithful in my tithes and offering, and in going and making disciple.
2. Ask the Lord to increase your faith
