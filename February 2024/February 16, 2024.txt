Judges 9, Luke 12, Acts 5,  Proverbs 16


RHEMA: Luke 12:18-21 NIV
“Then he said, ‘This is what I’ll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. And I’ll say to myself, “You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.”’ “But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?’ “This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God.”

C: Luke 12:35-Luke 12:36 NIV
“Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning, like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him.

P: Proverbs 16:16 NIV
How much better to get wisdom than gold, to get insight rather than silver!

W: Luke 12:15 NIV
Then he said to them, “Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.”


REFLECTION:
Not to be selfish.  I am blessed by God with a purpose. Not to expand my ownself. Pero gi bless ko ni Lord para maka store up ko ug mga disciples. Para ma empower nako ang mga gi entrust ni Lord sa ako na disciple, to build them up. Para sila maka stand sa ilang own in the glory of God. My richness should be in the expancion of God's kingdom. I will use my resources wisely, no more food craving! no more financial worries.
