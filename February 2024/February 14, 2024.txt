REFLECTION:

I will not be overpowered by my enemy. I will make myself stronger everyday. Kay everyday ga upgrade ang mga trails and challenges na gina atubang nako. Dili dapat ko mag stagnant, level up ko always. Dili lng sa physical pati pd sa spiritual.

To be more strong everyday:
1. spiritual discipline - dont take for granted ang mga secret places
2. physical discipline - the flesh is weak, dapat ipa strong pd, mo sabay ni siya sa Spiritual, Eat healthy foods, stay healthy.
