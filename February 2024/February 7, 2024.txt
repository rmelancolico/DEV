Judges 3, Matthew 27, Luke 6, Proverbs 7


RHEMA: Luke 6:43-45 NIV
“No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers. A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.


C: Luke 6:36 NIV
Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.
 

P: Luke 6:23 NIV
“Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their ancestors treated the prophets.



W: Luke 6:46, 49 NIV

“Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?

But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”



REFLECTION:
For me to be a good leader, I need to store good things in my heart. I will be carefull on what i learn, on what i view. I will pay more attention to the things that my leader are sharing. So that i could also share this to my disciples. I will acquire more knowledge and wisdom na e apply nako sa akong life ug e share nako sa akong mga discples.66
