Judges 13, Luke 16, Acts 9, Proverbs 23


RHEMA: Acts 9:13-14 NIV
“Lord,” Ananias answered, “I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem. And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.”


C: Proverbs 23:4-5 NIV
Do not wear yourself out to get rich; do not trust your own cleverness. Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone, for they will surely sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle.



P: Proverbs 23:17-18 NIV
Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always be zealous for the fear of the Lord. There is surely a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off.



W: Luke 16:11-12 NIV
So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else’s property, who will give you property of your own?


REFLECTION:
dili mag matter kung unsa ang imong past. what matters most to God is your obedience. sometimes ginahumo nako rason ang past sa isa ka tao para dili ko maka Go. Dapat dili nako ma limtan na Jesus also diead for them. And Jesus is aiming for that kind of a person. Dapat mo labaw ang akong compassion compare sa past sa isa ka tao. Walaon jud ang pag reason na dili mag Go. Dili sayangan ang annointing.
