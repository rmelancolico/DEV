REFLECTION:
financially short man ko karon, pero mangita ko ug ways para maka PIC ko. Dili reason na tungod wala koy money dili nako mag PIC. Like Zacchaeus, mangita ko ug ways para maka overcome ang shortness nako. Like also Zacchaeus, g desire niya na mailhan si Jesus, ug nag adto cya sa dalan na kung asa si Jesus mag adto. With that, I will go in Jesus' ways. Once makit.an na nako ang dalan kung asa si Jesus, dili lng ako ang mag benifits, pati pd ang akong household nako maka benifits pd.
