REFLECTION:
During the time of Jesus, many question Him. At first they dont believe Him. But because Jesus knows the scripture and the Holy Spirit is with Him, He answered all their question. So that nobody will doubt me, I need to be filled with the knowledge of the kingdom of God. I need to be filled by the Holy Spirit
