REFLECTION:

The Holy Spirit is in me already. I have communion with Him. Its time for me to go doing my God given purpose. I will cast out all fear, overthinking and advance negative thought. Whenever a negative thoughts come inside me, I will not be overcome. I will pray in the spirit. I will always put in to my mind that my fruits will be determine with my prayer and worship life. The higher the prayer and worship life the more desirable will my fruits be. No need for me to worry on the things that i needed, everything will be provided to me according to my fruits.
