John 3-4, Acts 8

C: John 4:24 NIV
God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.”


P: John 4:14 NIV
but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”



W: John 3:12 NIV
I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?



REFLECTION:
I will be reaping a harvest field that i didn't work for. I need to prepare myself, to become worthy of this harvest field and so that the labor of the Sower will be wasted. I can be trusted!

1. I need the knowledge and wisdom to preserve the Harvest
2. I need endurance to plant the harvest
3. I need patient to grow the planted
