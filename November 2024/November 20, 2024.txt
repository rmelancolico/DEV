John 15-16, Acts 14


RHEMA: John 15:8 NIV
This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.



C: John 15:4 NIV
Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.



P: John 15:7 NIV
If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.




W: John 15:2 NIV

<u>He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit</u>, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful.

I will bear much fruits in aspect of my life
