John 5-6, Acts 9


RHEMA: John 6:5-6 NIV
When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, “Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?” He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do.



C: John 6:27 NIV
Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.”



P: John 5:24 NIV
“Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life.




REFLECTION:
From time to time, God will test me. I will be more attentive to the test that God will give me on the spot. I should think like Jesus.
