RHEMA: John 9:4-5 NIV
As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work. While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”



C: John 10:16 NIV
I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.



P: John 10:10 NIV
The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; <u>I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.</u>



W:John 10:1 NIV

My works as a sheep gatherer will never stop, since Jesus is already in me.
