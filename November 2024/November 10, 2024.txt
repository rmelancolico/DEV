Luke 24, Acts 6


RHEMA: Luke 24:30-32 NIV
When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”

Luke 24:45 NIV
Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.


C: Luke 24:48 NIV
You are witnesses of these things.



P:


W: Luke 24:25 NIV
He said to them, “How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken!



REFLECTION:
True revelation will depend on how  much time your are spending with God. Bahala kapoy, bahala ma late sa work, dili nako e forsake ang akong prayer mountain! Dapat na jd ang burning desire sa kasingkasing para sa Word.
