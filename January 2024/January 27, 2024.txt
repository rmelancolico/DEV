REFLECTION:
There's no time for delay. I need to find ways na maka move na jd ko. I will choose 3 person, my PJJ. Dapat maka move na jd ko this quarter. I need to find ways na maka kuha ko ug katabang sa balay. Para dili ma byaan nako nag iisa ang akong wife sa balay. Enough na ang time na waste tungod wala ko nag go!
