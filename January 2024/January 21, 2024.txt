RHEMA: Matthew 13:31-33 NIV
He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.” He told them still another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.”


C: Mark 13:23 NIV
So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time.


P: Mark 13:11 NIV
Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.


W: Matthew 13:22 NIV
The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.


REFLECTION:
Bahala ginagmay basta naay ginabuhat, ma munga jud. The mustard is just small seed, but once you do something right to it (planting it right), it will grow big and become a blessings to other. So dapat, ginagmay ang buhaton nako (as of now), basta sakto, sure jd na mag grow ko
