RHEMA: Mark 4:26-29 NIV
He also said, “This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, <u>the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how</u>. All by itself <u>the soil produces</u> grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.”


C: John 4:24 NIV
God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.”


P: Proverbs 11:30 NIV
The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and the one who is wise saves lives.
