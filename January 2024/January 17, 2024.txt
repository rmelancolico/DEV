REFLECTION:
To see the harvest I need to have compassion. I will surrender my apathy to my Lord. The Holy Spirit reveal to me that my lack of concern for others is one the reason that I am not bearing fruits for God. Sayang ang harvest kung dili ko mag join. I had answer the call of God to be a harvester and I need to participate. I wont be doing my purpose if I wont harvest. I need to be more compassionate on my list of 12, i need to know them better to be able to cater to their needs
