RHEMA: Proverbs 3 Wisdom Bestows Well-Being


P: Acts 2:39 NIV
The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.”


W: Proverbs 3:7 NIV
Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord and shun evil.



REFLECTION:
Obtain wisdom for your supernatural 2024. Wisdom starts when you fear God
The importants of wisdom for my supernatural 2024

The whole Proverbs 3 is speaking about what can wisdom give you or do to you. It speaks about the important of having wisdom in your life.

And this are my takeaways: Wisdom really start from fear of God. You can be wise if you dont fear God. You need to follow His commands
