Joshua 8, Matthew 8, Mark 8, John 8, Proverbs 16


RHEMA: Mark 8:17-19 NIV
Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: “Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened? Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don’t you remember? When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?” “Twelve,” they replied.


P: Proverbs 16:20 NIV
Whoever gives heed to instruction prospers, and blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord.


W: Mark 8:33 NIV
But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. “Get behind me, Satan!” he said. “You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”


REFLECTION
I need fresh revelation. I need to go deeper and seek more of the Holy Spirit. I dont want to fail to see or fail to understand what God is doing in my life. Without revelation I will have no guide. One of the reason that I feel to see, is my doubt. Sometimes doubt overtakes me. I need to overcome my doubt, I need to jump in the river with my two feet.
