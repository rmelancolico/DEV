REFLECTION:
God requires me to show my for Him in 4 ways
1. Heart - dili pinogos. kasingkasing na paghigugma. Not because of the reward.
2. Soul - I need to be consecrated. God dont want a filthy people. For God is holy and His people should be Holy. I will do all my best to stay holy. Its only when i am holy, God can do supernaturals.
3. Mind - I should be thinking on how to expand God's kingdom. And not to worry on other things in this world, that will be provided. 
4. Strength - My strenght should be use to expand God's kingdom. Meaning, i need to do something. Not just planning, but work that plan.
