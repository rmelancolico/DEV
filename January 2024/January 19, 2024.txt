Joshua 11, Matthew 11, Mark 11, John 11, Proverbs 19


RHEMA: Mark 11:1-5 NIV
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples, saying to them, “Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.’” They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they untied it, some people standing there asked, “What are you doing, untying that colt?”


P: Mark 11:24 NIV
Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.



W: Proverbs 19:15 NIV
Laziness brings on deep sleep, and the shiftless go hungry.




REFLECTION:
Obedience to the Lord will not put you to harm. Naay times na ma hadlok ko mag go, because ma hadlok ko kung unsay reaction sa uban. Pero naay assurence si Lord. Dapat everytime ko mag go, i will always hold on to the assurance ni God sa ako. He will send me to place para ma experience nako ang akong supernatural. Thou, lisod siya sa pag tan.aw nako, dapat mag focus ko na kaya nako. Its not about me, its about obeying the command of God. Bahala sa tan.aw nako na maulawan ko, pero dili jd huna huna lng nako, go lng ko!
