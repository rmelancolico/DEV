REFLECTION:
I will consecrate myself today for my future ministy. God has prepare something big for me, and without today's consecration i will not experience fruitfulness. I will not move from where I am right now, if I dont consecrate myself, I will just be on the opposite side of the river. I will not take for granted this season of Prayer, fasting and giving. I will take my heart on it. And I will remember my covenant with my God. My covenant will serve as a tool or a reminder for my supernaturals
