Joshua 14, Matthew 14, Mark 14, John 14, Proverbs 22


RHEMA: Matthew 14:27-31 NIV
But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.” “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” “Come,” he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!” Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?”


C: Proverbs 22:6 NIV
Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it.


P: John 14:26 NIV
But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.


W: Mark 14:37-38 NIV
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. “Simon,” he said to Peter, “are you asleep? Couldn’t you keep watch for one hour? Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”


REFLECTION:
Before Peter did the supernatural, he confirm Jesus about it. He ask Jesus if it is really Him. Then God confirm it and allow Peter to experience supernatural. But Peter, loses his focus on the goal, he was overcome with his surrounding. But he called out the Name of Jesus and Jesus help him. Like Peter, I will always confirm my ways with Jesus. I want that every step I made should be connected to Jesus. On my journey to supernatural, I will face with alot of concerns for this world. But I will keep my focus and call on the Name of Jesus 

1. Meet the macro goals
2. focus on the God's revelation
3. be more concern of God's kingdom rather than earthly needs.
