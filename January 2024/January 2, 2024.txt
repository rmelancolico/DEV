Genesis 32, Proverbs 2, Acts 1


RHEMA: Acts 1:14 NIV
They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.


P: Genesis 32:12 NIV
But you have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.’”



REFLECTION:
Prayparation is very important as I become a witness to God's kingdom. I will go deeper on my prayer mountains, dapat always level up, dili level down, forward dili backwards.
