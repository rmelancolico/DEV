Genesis 35, Proverbs 6, Acts 4


RHEMA: Proverbs 6:20-23 NIV
My son, keep your father’s command and do not forsake your mother’s teaching. Bind them always on your heart; fasten them around your neck. When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you. For this command is a lamp, this teaching is a light, and correction and instruction are the way to life,



REFLECTION:
Since i am obeying God's command, I will be safe. Do i really obey God's command? I will make it sure that I obey them
