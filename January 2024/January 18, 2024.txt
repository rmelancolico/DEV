Joshua 10, Matthew 10, Mark 10, John 10, Proverbs 18


RHEMA: Mark 10:47-50 NIV
When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” So they called to the blind man, “Cheer up! On your feet! He’s calling you.” Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.


C: Matthew 10:16-17 NIV
“I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues.


W: Proverbs 18:9 NIV
One who is slack in his work is brother to one who destroys.



REFLECTION:
In my journey as a disciple of Jesus, i will face many discouragement, I will face many more rejection. But I will not stop shouting for the Name of Jesus. I will not stop praising the name of Jesus. I will continue call on the Name of Jesus. Because one day those who prosecute me, will one day see that God is doing great things in my life, and together they will also praise God with me
