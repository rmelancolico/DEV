REFLECTION:
Jesus required me to bear fruits. God has entrusted me with fruits, I need to harvest them. It is my duty to be a harvester in his field and to give to Him is portion. I got skills, i got talents from God. This should reproduces. If i dont work this out, this will be given to others. I will show that I can be trusted and produce what God has given to me
