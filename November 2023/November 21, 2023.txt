REFLECTION:
On Genesis 23, Abraham was looking for a field to burry is wife Sarah. Now, Abraham was honored by all of the Hitites. He was considered powerful and wealthy by them. And the were willing to give any land that Abraham wants. But Abraham didnt take advantage of this. Abraham wanted to pay for the land. Abraham showed humbleness and standard that he wont burry is dead without paying. For it, it is very important that I should be always humble, and not to think that i am above. I should always remember that my feet should stay on the ground. And also to put standard in everything, and not to go below the set standard
