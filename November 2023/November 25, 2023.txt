Genesis 25, Proverbs 25, John 16


RHEMA: Proverbs 25:2 NIV
It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings.


P: John 16:33 NIV
“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”


W: Proverbs 25:26-28 NIV
Like a muddied spring or a polluted well are the righteous who give way to the wicked. It is not good to eat too much honey, nor is it honorable to search out matters that are too deep. Like a city whose walls are broken through is a person who lacks self-control.



REFLECTION:
I will search for knowledge, both heavenly and on my career.

1. I will remove distraction to set focus
2. I will invest on my learnings
