Genesis 27, Proverbs 28, John 17


RHEMA: John 17:6-9 NIV
“I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word. Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you. For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me. I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours.

P: Genesis 27:28 NIV
May God give you heaven’s dew and earth’s richness— an abundance of grain and new wine.


W: Proverbs 28:27 NIV
Those who give to the poor will lack nothing, but those who close their eyes to them receive many curses.
