Genesis 24, Proverbs 23, John 15


RHEMA: Proverbs 23:4 NIV
Do not wear yourself out to get rich; do not trust your own cleverness.


C: John 15:17 NIV
This is my command: Love each other.



REFECTION:
I will focus on what is more important. Doing what is required of me by God. Dili nako angay magpabusy para lng maka money. Instead, I will make myself busy doing God's work
