Genesis 17, [Proverbs 10, John 10]


RHEMA: Genesis 17:7 NIV
I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.


C: Genesis 17:1-2 NIV
When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him and said, “I am God Almighty; walk before me faithfully and be blameless. Then I will make my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers.”



P: Genesis 17:15-16 NIV
God also said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah. I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”



REFLECTION:
The promise of God is not only just for me, but also for my wife, for my next generation. God has promise me a son. There's no turning back now. I will work hard for the promise of God.

1. Strengthen basic life style - naay fruitfulness na mo abot sa ako. Dapat prepare ko ani para ma preserve nako ang harvest. Dapat hugot ang akong prayer life labi na ang akong devotional life.

2.  Focus - no need na mo lingi2x sa past. Like sa bible passage na walay mag plow sa iyang land na naka lingi2 sa likod, kay kung sigig lingi mahiwi ang pag plow.

3. Doubt - remove doubt, you are called to multiply. Promise ni Lord na you will not be harm

4. Work hard - work hard for the promise ni Lord. Dili gusto si Lord ug mga tapulan na mga tao. Dapat mapakita ka na gusto pd nimo ang iyang promise.
