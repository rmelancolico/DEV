Genesis 20, Proverbs 14, John 12


RHEMA: John 12:36,46 NIV
Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may become children of light.‚Äù When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.

I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.




P: Proverbs 14:4 NIV
Where there are no oxen, the manger is empty, but from the strength of an ox come abundant harvests.


REFLECTION:
I will not doubt my Light. I have become light to help other stay away from the darkness. I will keep my focus as a light and do as light should do. I will not idle myself. I will walk my light so that i could search on the darkness and help others to develop there light.
