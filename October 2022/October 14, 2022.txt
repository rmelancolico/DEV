Isaiah 22, Genises 22, Proverbs 14, 1 Peter 1

M: GNT 1 Peter 1:6-7
Be glad about this, even though it may now be necessary for you to be sad for a while because of the many kinds of trials you suffer.  Their purpose is to prove that your faith is genuine. Even gold, which can be destroyed, is tested by fire; and so your faith, which is much more precious than gold, must also be tested, so that it may endure. Then you will receive praise and glory and honor on the Day when Jesus Christ is revealed.

C: GNT 1 Peter 1:14-15
Be obedient to God, and do not allow your lives to be shaped by those desires you had when you were still ignorant.  Instead, be holy in all that you do, just as God who called you is holy.

P: GNT Isaiah 22:23
I will fasten him firmly in place like a peg, and he will be a source of honor to his whole family.

W: GNT Isaiah 22:11
you built a reservoir inside the city to hold the water flowing down from the old pool. But you paid no attention to God, who planned all this long ago and who caused it to happen.

A: my faith is genuine, i will not lost it. I always pay attention to my God given purpose
