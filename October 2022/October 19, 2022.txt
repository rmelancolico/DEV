Isaiah 26, Genises 26, Proverbs 19, 1 Peter 5

M: GNT Isaiah 26:3
You, Lord, give perfect peace to those who keep their purpose firm and put their trust in you.

C: GNT 1 Peter 5:5-7
In the same way you younger people must submit yourselves to your elders. And all of you must put on the apron of humility, to serve one another; for the scripture says, “God resists the proud, but shows favor to the humble.”  Humble yourselves, then, under God's mighty hand, so that he will lift you up in his own good time.  Leave all your worries with him, because he cares for you.

P: GNT Genesis 26:4
I will give you as many descendants as there are stars in the sky, and I will give them all this territory. All the nations will ask me to bless them as I have blessed your descendants.

W: GNT 1 Peter 5:8
Be alert, be on watch! Your enemy, the Devil, roams around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.

A: i will be firm in my purpose. For i have put my trust in my God
