Isaiah 30, Genises 30, Proverbs 23, 1 John 1

M: GNT 1 John 1:5-7
Now the message that we have heard from his Son and announce is this: God is light, and there is no darkness at all in him.  If, then, we say that we have fellowship with him, yet at the same time live in the darkness, we are lying both in our words and in our actions.  But if we live in the light—just as he is in the light—then we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from every sin.

C: GNT Proverbs 23:4-5
 Be wise enough not to wear yourself out trying to get rich.  Your money can be gone in a flash, as if it had grown wings and flown away like an eagle.

P: GNT Isaiah 30:19
You people who live in Jerusalem will not weep any more. The Lord is compassionate, and when you cry to him for help, he will answer you.

W: GNT Isaiah 30:5
the people of Judah will regret that they ever trusted that unreliable nation, a nation that fails them when they expect help.”

A: i will not lie with my words. What i speak should be a light to others
