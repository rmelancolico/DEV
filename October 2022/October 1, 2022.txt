Isaiah 9, Genises 9, Proverbs 1, Hebrews 6


M: GNT Hebrews 6:1
Let us go forward, then, to mature teaching and leave behind us the first lessons of the Christian message. We should not lay again the foundation of turning away from useless works and believing in God;

C: GNT Genesis 9:7
“You must have many children, so that your descendants will live all over the earth.”

P: GNT Hebrews 6:9-10
But even if we speak like this, dear friends, we feel sure about you. We know that you have the better blessings that belong to your salvation.  God is not unfair. He will not forget the work you did or the love you showed for him in the help you gave and are still giving to other Christians.

W: GNT Proverbs 1:10
My child, when sinners tempt you, don't give in.

A: i will be mature, i will grow my spirituality.
