Isaiah 31, Genises 31, Proverbs 24, 1 John 2


M: GNT 1 John 2:3-6
If we obey God's commands, then we are sure that we know him.  If we say that we know him, but do not obey his commands, we are liars and there is no truth in us.  But if we obey his word, we are the ones whose love for God has really been made perfect. This is how we can be sure that we are in union with God:  if we say that we remain in union with God, we should live just as Jesus Christ did.

C: GNT Genesis 31:16
All this wealth which God has taken from our father belongs to us and to our children. Do whatever God has told you.”

P: GNT Isaiah 31:5
Just as a bird hovers over its nest to protect its young, so I, the Lord Almighty, will protect Jerusalem and defend it.”

W: GNT Isaiah 31:1
Those who go to Egypt for help are doomed! They are relying on Egypt's vast military strength—horses, chariots, and soldiers. But they do not rely on the Lord, the holy God of Israel, or ask him for help.
