Isaiah 37, Genises 37, Proverbs 30, Jude 1

M: GNT Jude 1:3
My dear friends, I was doing my best to write to you about the salvation we share in common, when I felt the need of writing at once to encourage you to fight on for the faith which once and for all God has given to his people.

C: GNT Jude 1:20-21
But you, my friends, keep on building yourselves up on your most sacred faith. Pray in the power of the Holy Spirit,  and keep yourselves in the love of God, as you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ in his mercy to give you eternal life.

P: GNT Isaiah 37:31
Those in Judah who survive will flourish like plants that send roots deep into the ground and produce fruit.

W: GNT Jude 1:5
For even though you know all this, I want to remind you of how the Lord once rescued the people of Israel from Egypt, but afterward destroyed those who did not believe.

A: i will not be timid, i will defend and fight for my faith, i will continue to build up myself in the presence of God and always be filled by Holy Spirit
