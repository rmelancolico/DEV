Zechariah 13, Proverbs 12, Luke 13


RHEMA: Luke 13:8-9 NIV
“‘Sir,’ the man replied, ‘leave it alone for one more year, and I’ll dig around it and fertilize it. If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.’”



C: Luke 13:24 NIV
“Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to.


REFLECTION:
I will make every effort to bear fruits!

Dig arround -> to go deeper sa secret place. Backhoe na ang gamiton sa pag kalot
Fertilizer  -> be sensitive sa Word of God. Dapat maka dungog always sa Word. devotional
