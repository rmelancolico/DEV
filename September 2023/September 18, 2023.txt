Malachi 2, Proverbs 18, Luke 16



RHEMA: Luke 16:10-12 NIV
“Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else’s property, who will give you property of your own?


W: Malachi 2:15-16 NIV
Has not the one God made you? You belong to him in body and spirit. And what does the one God seek? Godly offspring. So be on your guard, and do not be unfaithful to the wife of your youth. “The man who hates and divorces his wife,” says the Lord, the God of Israel, “does violence to the one he should protect,” says the Lord Almighty. So be on your guard, and do not be unfaithful.



REFLECTION:
I will be trusted with a little. Manikamot ko sa akong Monday Life Group circle na ma perserve nako ni sila. Ipakita nako na masaligan ko sa ila. My fruitfulness will start from there! I will learn from this journey para naa koy skills magamit sa mga dinagko.
