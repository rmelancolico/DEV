Zechariah 11, Proverbs 5, Luke 11


RHEMA: Luke 11:8-10 NIV
I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship, yet because of your shameless audacity he will surely get up and give you as much as you need. “So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.


C: Luke 11:42 NIV
“Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.


REFLECTION:
I will keep on asking God for that the Holy Spirit will really manifest in my family.
Higher mountain to climb
Increase faithfulness
