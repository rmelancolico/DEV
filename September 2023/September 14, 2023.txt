REFLECTION:
I have a ministry to do. I were once a irresponsible son, but now that I am back and my Father welcomes me back. I need to show my thankfulness and love to Him by doing what i am design to do:

1. I have authority over satan, the power to overcome sin and to cast evil spirits
2. I have work to do - to make disciples
3. To rejoice in the richness glory of my God
