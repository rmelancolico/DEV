Malachi 4, Proverbs 20, Luke 18


RHEMA: Luke 18:36-39 NIV
When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening. They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.” He called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”


P: Malachi 4:2 NIV
But for you who revere my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its rays. And you will go out and frolic like well-fed calves.



W: Proverbs 20:4 NIV
Sluggards do not plow in season; so at harvest time they look but find nothing.



REFLECTION:
I will shout the Name of Jesus, bahala unsay situation sa akong life. Walay maka pugong sa ako na mag shout, dili tao, dili kwarta. Dili rason na tungod wala koy kwarta dili ko mag PIC. Mangita ko paagi na maka PIC. Dugay na ko nag hulat, nag laom na naay ma PIC. karon na nag abot na, maningkamot ko. Tarongon nako ang pag budget sa akong money.
