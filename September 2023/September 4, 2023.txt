Zechariah 10, Proverbs 4, Luke 10

RHEMA: Luke 10:40-42 NIV
But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!” “Martha, Martha,” the Lord answered, “you are worried and upset about many things, but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.”


C: Proverbs 4:5-6 NIV
Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or turn away from them. Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will watch over you.


APPLICATION:
I will balance my work, between my family time, between my carrier, between my minister. But above all, I will spend more time with Jesus. It is important that my time with Jesus is absulote!
