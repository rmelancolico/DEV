REFLECTION:
into the deep waters! I just realize, sa life sa mga disciples, it was during that when they are inside a boat, that their faith is been tested. When they got in a boat, storms follows. This means, that if we desire to go into deeper waters. We must be prepared for a storm. But always remember that Jesus is always there for us. We will not be alone. Also it is in deeper water(or in the boat) that the disciple experience an abundant catch.

1. Whatever happen, i will continue to go deeper
2. the deeper i go, the larger the catch
