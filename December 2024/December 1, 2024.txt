Mark 7-8, Acts 21


RHEMA: Mark 8:2-3 NIV
“I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, because some of them have come a long distance.”

C: Mark 8:34 NIV
Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.


P: Mark 7:29 NIV
Then he told her, “For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.”


W: Mark 7:15 NIV

Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them.”


REFLECTION:
Keep on following Jesus' path, dili mag dugay Jesus will see me, have compassion and He provide me  satisfaction in my ministry. Dili ko pa byaan ni Jesus. For 3 days, seryosohon jd na nako ang time prayer and fasting! I will commit to it!
