REFLECTION:
I need to shine my light so that many people will see God's salvation. It is my doing that people will see

Every valley shall be filled in - meeting place will be filled by soul

every mountain and hill made low - dapat dili na kapoy sa ako ang mosaka sa prayer mountain ug sa mga secret places nako
