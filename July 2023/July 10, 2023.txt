RHEMA: Mark 8:17-18 NIV
Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: “Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened? Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don’t you remember?



W: Nahum 2:1 NIV
An attacker advances against you, Nineveh. Guard the fortress, watch the road, brace yourselves, marshal all your strength!




REFLECTION:
I will always see the goodness of God in every session that I am. Bahala unsa man na, padayon ko ug too, padayon ko mangalagad. Lig.onon nako ang akong pag too dya sa Ginoo, mag laumon ko.
