Nahum 3, Judges 11, Mark 9, Revelation 14


RHEMA: Mark 9:21-24 NIV
Jesus asked the boy’s father, “How long has he been like this?” “From childhood,” he answered. “It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.” “‘If you can’?” said Jesus. “Everything is possible for one who believes.” Immediately the boy’s father exclaimed, “I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!”



C: Revelation 14:15 NIV
Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, “Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.”




W: Mark 9:19 NIV
“You unbelieving generation,” Jesus replied, “how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.”




REFLECTION:
Do not limit sa power of God. sa Mark 9, naka ingon ang father na "if you can?". Pero dapat nako e increase ang akong faith! Padayon ko sa akong ginabuhat para sa Ginoo
