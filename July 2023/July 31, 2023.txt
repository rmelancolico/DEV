Habakkuk 2, Judges 13, Mark 11, Revelation 16


RHEMA: Mark 11:22-24 NIV
“Have faith in God,” Jesus answered. “Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.


C: Habakkuk 2:4 NIV
“See, the enemy is puffed up; his desires are not upright— but the righteous person will live by his faithfulness—


P: Habakkuk 2:3 NIV
For the revelation awaits an appointed time; it speaks of the end and will not prove false. Though it linger, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay.


REFLECTION:
I will commit to the Lord with faith. A faith that can move a mountain. meaning, if mag commit ko kang Lord, dapat kanang impossible nako buhaton. ug dya ma increase nako ang akong faith
