Micah 6, Judges 8, Mark 6, [Revelation 12]

RHEMA: NIV Mark 6:5-6
He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. He was amazed at their lack of faith...

C:  NIV Micah 6:8
He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.


REFLECTION:
My big miracle will start with my big faith. Dili makapamuhat ug tarong ang Ginoo sa ako kinabuhi kung taphow lng ang akong pagtoo or faith.

To have faith means to be obedient - dapat mabuhat nako ang akong God given hope
To have faith means to get fresh revelation - dili ko magluyo kung naa always new revelation from God. And to obtain this revelation, i need to read His Word
