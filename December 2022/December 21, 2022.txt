Jeremiah 16, Exodus 32, Matthew 23, Romans 12


M: Romans 12:1-2 GNT
So then, my friends, because of God's great mercy to us I appeal to you: Offer yourselves as a living sacrifice to God, dedicated to his service and pleasing to him. This is the true worship that you should offer. Do not conform yourselves to the standards of this world, but let God transform you inwardly by a complete change of your mind. Then you will be able to know the will of God—what is good and is pleasing to him and is perfect.


C: Exodus 32:34 GNT
Now go, lead the people to the place I told you about. Remember that my angel will guide you, but the time is coming when I will punish these people for their sin.”


P:


W: Romans 12:21 GNT
Do not let evil defeat you; instead, conquer evil with good.



A: I Will offer myself as a living sacrifice to God. I will function to my God given purpose
