Jeremiah 7, Exodus 23, Matthew 14, Romans 5


M: Romans 5:3-5 GNT
We also boast of our troubles, because we know that trouble produces endurance, endurance brings God's approval, and his approval creates hope. This hope does not disappoint us, for God has poured out his love into our hearts by means of the Holy Spirit, who is God's gift to us.



C: Matthew 14:27 GNT
Jesus spoke to them at once. “Courage!” he said. “It is I. Don't be afraid!”



P:


W: Matthew 14:29-31 GNT
“Come!” answered Jesus. So Peter got out of the boat and started walking on the water to Jesus. But when he noticed the strong wind, he was afraid and started to sink down in the water. “Save me, Lord!” he cried. At once Jesus reached out and grabbed hold of him and said, “What little faith you have! Why did you doubt?”


A: I have already decided to walk to Jesus. This decision will bring me troubles. But i will not be afraid, Because God has commanded me not be afraid and He promis that He will always be with me. This trouble of mine will make me mature in everything.
