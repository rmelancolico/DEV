Jeremiah 18, Exodus 34


M: GNT Jeremiah 18:6
“Don't I have the right to do with you people of Israel what the potter did with the clay? You are in my hands just like clay in the potter's hands.

C: GNT Exodus 34:11-12
Obey the laws that I am giving you today. I will drive out the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, as you advance.  Do not make any treaties with the people of the country into which you are going, because this could be a fatal trap for you.

P: GNT Exodus 34:10
The Lord said to Moses, “I now make a covenant with the people of Israel. In their presence I will do great things such as have never been done anywhere on earth among any of the nations. All the people will see what great things I, the Lord, can do, because I am going to do an awesome thing for you.

W: GNT Exodus 34:7
I keep my promise for thousands of generations and forgive evil and sin; but I will not fail to punish children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generation for the sins of their parents.”

A: i will let God mold me. I should be more intentional with my devotional, so that I could be what God wants me to be. I will be careful not to sin, so that my next generation will be safe
