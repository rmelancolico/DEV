Jeremiah 2, Exodus 18, Matthew 9, Acts 28


M: GNT Matthew 9:16-17
“No one patches up an old coat with a piece of new cloth, for the new patch will shrink and make an even bigger hole in the coat.  Nor does anyone pour new wine into used wineskins, for the skins will burst, the wine will pour out, and the skins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is poured into fresh wineskins, and both will keep in good condition.”

C: GNT Matthew 9:37-38
So he said to his disciples, “The harvest is large, but there are few workers to gather it in.  Pray to the owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather in his harvest.”

W: GNT Jeremiah 2:25
Israel, don't wear your feet out, or let your throat become dry from chasing after other gods. But you say, ‘No! I can't turn back. I have loved foreign gods and will go after them.’”

A: i have been made new in Jesus Christ, this mean that there is no room for my old habbits, old skills, old attitude.


GNT Jeremiah 2:35
you say, ‘I am innocent; surely the Lord is no longer angry with me.’ But I, the Lord, will punish you because you deny that you have sinned.
