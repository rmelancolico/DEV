Jeremiah 21, Exodus 37, Matthew 27, Romans 15

M: GNT Matthew 27:41-43
In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the Law and the elders made fun of him:  “He saved others, but he cannot save himself! Isn't he the king of Israel? If he will come down off the cross now, we will believe in him!  He trusts in God and claims to be God's Son. Well, then, let us see if God wants to save him now!”

C: GNT Romans 15:1-2
We who are strong in the faith ought to help the weak to carry their burdens. We should not please ourselves.  Instead, we should all please other believers for their own good, in order to build them up in the faith.
