Jeremiah 13, Exodus 29, Matthew 20, Romans 10


M: Matthew 20:15-16 GNT
Don't I have the right to do as I wish with my own money? Or are you jealous because I am generous?’” And Jesus concluded, “So those who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last.”


C: Matthew 20:26-28 GNT
This, however, is not the way it shall be among you. If one of you wants to be great, you must be the servant of the rest; and if one of you wants to be first, you must be the slave of the others— like the Son of Man, who did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life to redeem many people.”


P: Romans 10:11 GNT
The scripture says, “Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.”


W: Romans 10:14-15 GNT
But how can they call to him for help if they have not believed? And how can they believe if they have not heard the message? And how can they hear if the message is not proclaimed? And how can the message be proclaimed if the messengers are not sent out? As the scripture says, “How wonderful is the coming of messengers who bring good news!”


A: I wont be jealous, when God promote others. The most important thing is that I do the work of God, it doesnt matter if God will bless later on. But I will be expectant that God will level up me. I need to do my part in preaching Jesus
