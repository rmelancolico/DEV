Jeremiah 1, Exodus 17, Matthew 8, Acts 27


M: Jeremiah 1:7-9 GNT
But the Lord said to me, “Do not say that you are too young, but go to the people I send you to, and tell them everything I command you to say. Do not be afraid of them, for I will be with you to protect you. I, the Lord, have spoken!” Then the Lord reached out, touched my lips, and said to me, “Listen, I am giving you the words you must speak.



C: Jeremiah 1:17 GNT
Get ready, Jeremiah; go and tell them everything I command you to say. Do not be afraid of them now, or I will make you even more afraid when you are with them.



P: Jeremiah 18-19 GNT
Listen, Jeremiah! Everyone in this land—the kings of Judah, the officials, the priests, and the people—will be against you. But today I am giving you the strength to resist them; you will be like a fortified city, an iron pillar, and a bronze wall. They will not defeat you, for I will be with you to protect you. I, the Lord, have spoken.”



W: Matthew 8:26 GNT
“Why are you so frightened?” Jesus answered. “What little faith you have!” Then he got up and ordered the winds and the waves to stop, and there was a great calm.
