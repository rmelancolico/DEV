“Come to me, all of you who are tired from carrying heavy loads, and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke and put it on you, and learn from me, because I am gentle and humble in spirit; and you will find rest.  For the yoke I will give you is easy, and the load I will put on you is light.”

C: GNT Romans 2:6-7
For God will reward each of us according to what we have done.  Some people keep on doing good, and seek glory, honor, and immortal life; to them God will give eternal life.

P: GNT Exodus 20:6

W: GNT Romans 2:13
