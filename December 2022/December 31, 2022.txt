Jeremiah 22, Exodus 38, Matthew 28 (Romans 16)


M: Matthew 28:6-7 GNT
He is not here; he has been raised, just as he said. Come here and see the place where he was lying. Go quickly now, and tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from death, and now he is going to Galilee ahead of you; there you will see him!’ Remember what I have told you.”



C: Jeremiah 22:3 GNT
“I, the Lord, command you to do what is just and right. Protect the person who is being cheated from the one who is cheating him. Do not mistreat or oppress aliens, orphans, or widows; and do not kill innocent people in this holy place.



P: Matthew 28:20 GNT
and teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And I will be with you always, to the end of the age.”


W: Jeremiah 22:5 GNT
But if you do not obey my commands, then I swear to you that this palace will fall into ruins. I, the Lord, have spoken.



A: God is always true to His promise. This will be my encouragement, my inspiration to do my God given purpose. It is a command by God not a request
