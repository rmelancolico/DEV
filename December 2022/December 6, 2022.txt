Jeremiah 6, Exodus 22, Matthew 13, Romans 4


M: Matthew 13:11-12 GNT
Jesus answered, “The knowledge about the secrets of the Kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. For the person who has something will be given more, so that he will have more than enough; but the person who has nothing will have taken away from him even the little he has.


C: Exodus 22:29-30 GNT
“Give me the offerings from your grain, your wine, and your olive oil when they are due. “Give me your first-born sons. Give me the first-born of your cattle and your sheep. Let the first-born male stay with its mother for seven days, and on the eighth day offer it to me.



P: Matthew 13:23 GNT
And the seeds sown in the good soil stand for those who hear the message and understand it: they bear fruit, some as much as one hundred, others sixty, and others thirty.”


W: Matthew 13:21-22 GNT
But it does not sink deep into them, and they don't last long. So when trouble or persecution comes because of the message, they give up at once. The seeds that fell among thorn bushes stand for those who hear the message; but the worries about this life and the love for riches choke the message, and they don't bear fruit.



A: The knowledge about the secrets of the Kingdom of God was given to me, and it is my responsibility to share this to others. I should really put more effort in making new friends and to invite them with the intention of making them disciples.
