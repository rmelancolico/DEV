Jeremiah 46, Leviticus 22, Matthew 17, 2 Corinthians 7


RHEMA: Matthew 17:20 GNT
“It was because you do not have enough faith,” answered Jesus. “I assure you that if you have faith as big as a mustard seed, you can say to this hill, ‘Go from here to there!’ and it will go. You could do anything!”



C: 2 Corinthians 7:1 GNT
All these promises are made to us, my dear friends. So then, let us purify ourselves from everything that makes body or soul unclean, and let us be completely holy by living in awe of God.



REFLECTION:

I dont have enough faith! Lord, increase my faith. I dont want to  be failer in my ministry. Help me Lord to overcome all the mountains. Help me understand more your ways and principles.
