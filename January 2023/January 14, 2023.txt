RHEMA: GNT Leviticus 11:44-45

P: GNT Jeremiah 35:18-19
Then I told the Rechabite clan that the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, had said, “You have obeyed the command that your ancestor Jonadab gave you; you have followed all his instructions, and you have done everything he commanded you.  So I, the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, promise that Jonadab son of Rechab will always have a male descendant to serve me.”

W: GNT Matthew 6:1
Teaching about Charity “Make certain you do not perform your religious duties in public so that people will see what you do. If you do these things publicly, you will not have any reward from your Father in heaven.

Reflection: as a leader of leaders, i should be concern with making myself holy. To consecrate myself, to dress pleasing, to look pleasing and to act as God instructed me. Prayer and fasting is a key ways to consecrate myself
