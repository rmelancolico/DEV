Jeremiah 49, Leviticus 25, Matthew 20, 2 Corinthians 10



RHEMA: Matthew 20:26-27 GNT
This, however, is not the way it shall be among you. If one of you wants to be great, you must be the servant of the rest; and if one of you wants to be first, you must be the slave of the others—



C: Leviticus 25:55 GNT
Israelites cannot be permanent slaves, because the people of Israel are the Lord's slaves. He brought them out of Egypt; he is the Lord their God.

REFLECTION
I will be happily serving others. When my leader wants me to do something, I will make sure that i will do my best to fullfil that. I will not grumble nor reason out just to make it appear hard. I will live a life of servanthood.
