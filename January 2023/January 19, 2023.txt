Jeremiah 39, Leviticus 15, Matthew 10, 1 Corinthians 16


RHEMA: Matthew 10:19-20 GNT
When they bring you to trial, do not worry about what you are going to say or how you will say it; when the time comes, you will be given what you will say. For the words you will speak will not be yours; they will come from the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.

P: Matthew 10:40-42 GNT
“Whoever welcomes you welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. Whoever welcomes God's messenger because he is God's messenger, will share in his reward. And whoever welcomes a good man because he is good, will share in his reward. You can be sure that whoever gives even a drink of cold water to one of the least of these my followers because he is my follower, will certainly receive a reward.”



W: Matthew 10:16 GNT
“Listen! I am sending you out just like sheep to a pack of wolves. You must be as cautious as snakes and as gentle as doves.



A: When the time comes, I will not be afraid on what and how to share the Word of God, but before that come, I will prepare myself for the work of God. I will practice standing for a long time. And I will store up heavenly knowledge
