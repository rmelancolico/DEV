Jeremiah 37, Leviticus 13, Matthew 8, 1 Corinthians 14


RHEMA: 1 Corinthians 14:1, 39-40 GNT
It is love, then, that you should strive for. Set your hearts on spiritual gifts, especially the gift of proclaiming God's message.

So then, my friends, set your heart on proclaiming God's message, but do not forbid the speaking in strange tongues. Everything must be done in a proper and orderly way.




W: Matthew 8:26 GNT
“Why are you so frightened?” Jesus answered. “What little faith you have!” Then he got up and ordered the winds and the waves to stop, and there was a great calm.



A: I already have the gifts of tongue, now i will desire to receive the gift of proclaiming God's message. To be effective leader, i should be effective in helping others and the gift of proclaiming God's message will be my tool to help others. I will make myself fully equip and be always ready to proclaim.
