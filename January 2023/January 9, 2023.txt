Jeremiah 30, Leviticus 6, Matthew 1, 1 Corinthians 7


M: 1 Corinthians 7:17-20 GNT
Each of you should go on living according to the Lord's gift to you, and as you were when God called you. This is the rule I teach in all the churches.If a circumcised man has accepted God's call, he should not try to remove the marks of circumcision; if an uncircumcised man has accepted God's call, he should not get circumcised. For whether or not a man is circumcised means nothing; what matters is to obey God's commandments.


C: Jeremiah 30:1-2 GNT
