Jeremiah 45, Leviticus 21, Matthew 16, 2 Corinthians 6


RHEMA:
Matthew 16:17-19 GNT
“Good for you, Simon son of John!” answered Jesus. “For this truth did not come to you from any human being, but it was given to you directly by my Father in heaven. And so I tell you, Peter: you are a rock, and on this rock foundation I will build my church, and not even death will ever be able to overcome it. I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of heaven; what you prohibit on earth will be prohibited in heaven, and what you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven.”


W: Matthew 16:8 GNT
Jesus knew what they were saying, so he asked them, “Why are you discussing among yourselves about not having any bread? What little faith you have!



REFLECTION:
I need fresh revelation from God everyday. The key to be always a rock, a firm foundation, is to have fresh revelation everyday. To have fresh revelation, I need to be more focus on my devotional, to not be destracted to anything during devo time. And to always writeit down!
