Jeremiah 38, Leviticus 14, Matthew 9, 1 Corinthians 15


RHEMA: Matthew 9:16-17 GNT
“No one patches up an old coat with a piece of new cloth, for the new patch will shrink and make an even bigger hole in the coat. Nor does anyone pour new wine into used wineskins, for the skins will burst, the wine will pour out, and the skins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is poured into fresh wineskins, and both will keep in good condition.”



C: 1 Corinthians 15:58 GNT
So then, my dear friends, stand firm and steady. Keep busy always in your work for the Lord, since you know that nothing you do in the Lord's service is ever useless.


W: 1 Corinthians 15: 50 GNT
What I mean, friends, is that what is made of flesh and blood cannot share in God's Kingdom, and what is mortal cannot possess immortality.


A: I have been made new in Jesus Christ. I am a new creation. And I will not allow my old self to be patch back on my new life, nor i will not my new spirit be poured by my old spirit! I will keep on pouring new spirit on my life
