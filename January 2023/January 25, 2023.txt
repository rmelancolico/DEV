Jeremiah 44, Leviticus 20, Matthew 15, 2 Corinthians 5


RHEMA: 2 Corinthians 5:4 While we live in this earthly tent, we groan with a feeling of oppression; it is not that we want to get rid of our earthly body, but that we want to have the heavenly one put on over us, so that what is mortal will be transformed by life.


C: Leviticus 20:7-8 GNT
Keep yourselves holy, because I am the Lord your God. Obey my laws, because I am the Lord and I make you holy.”


P: Leviticus 20:23-24 GNT
Do not adopt the customs of the people who live there; I am driving out those pagans so that you can enter the land. They have disgusted me with all their evil practices. But I have promised you this rich and fertile land as your possession, and I will give it to you. I am the Lord your God, and I have set you apart from the other nations.



REFLECTION:
God wants me to be holy. I will have a heavenly body put me. I can maintain my holiness by going deeper with my relationship with the Holy Spirit. Thus I will make every effort to go deeper with my relationship, go deeper with my heavenly knowledge with application, by sharing to those that who are still in darkness
