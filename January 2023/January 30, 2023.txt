Jeremiah 48, Leviticus 24, Matthew 19, 2 Corinthians 9


RHEMA: 19:23-24 GNT
Jesus then said to his disciples, “I assure you: it will be very hard for rich people to enter the Kingdom of heaven. I repeat: it is much harder for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle.”



P: 2 Corinthians 9:10-11 GNT
And God, who supplies seed for the sower and bread to eat, will also supply you with all the seed you need and will make it grow and produce a rich harvest from your generosity. He will always make you rich enough to be generous at all times, so that many will thank God for your gifts which they receive from us.



REFLECTION:
My riches will come from God and not by my own strenght. I will always remember that God provides me riches for the expantion of His kingdom. To attain riches from God, I will always seek His will for me, seek His commands and to work hard on my field.
