M: GNT Mark 2:22
Nor does anyone pour new wine into used wineskins, because the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. Instead, new wine must be poured into fresh wineskins.”

C: GNT 1 Corinthians 1:10
By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ I appeal to all of you, my friends, to agree in what you say, so that there will be no divisions among you. Be completely united, with only one thought and one purpose.

P: GNT Jeremiah 24:7
I will give them the desire to know that I am the Lord. Then they will be my people, and I will be their God, because they will return to me with all their heart.

W: GNT 1 Corinthians 1:29,31
This means that no one can boast in God's presence.  So then, as the scripture says, “Whoever wants to boast must boast of what the Lord has done.”


A: i am a new wine skin! I will be filled with the Holy Spirit, no more old wine!
