REFLECTION:
always walk in the light. Dili lalim ang mag walk sa imong God given purpose. Dapat always jud walk in the presence of God.

How not to stumble

1. Remember the truth in you - you know the truth, which is the truth about Jesus. It is not enough na know the Jesus on a knowledge level lng(He is God, He died in the cross and on the 3rd day He rose), dapat in experience level jd

2. Join the conquest - do not be left behind sa mga lihuk sa church, dapat mo sabay ta. The light is always moving! sabay sa light

3. Dont work in the darkness - secret sins
