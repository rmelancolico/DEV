1 Samuel 6, John 10, Acts 27, Proverbs 8


RHEMA: John 10:11-13 NIV
“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.



C: Acts 27:25-26 NIV
So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me. Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island.”



P: Proverbs 8:10-11 NIV
Choose my instruction instead of silver, knowledge rather than choice gold, for wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire can compare with her.



W: Proverbs 8:36 NIV
But those who fail to find me harm themselves; all who hate me love death.”
