REFLECTION:
Continues work for the kingdom of God. Dili ko dapat bation ug kakapoy kung mamohat ko para sa Ginoo. Jesus is my light, naa sa Iya ang tanan need nako para dili kapoyon. Ang need lng nako buhaton is mag palalom jd ko sa presence sa Holy Spirit. Kay si Holy Spirit mao ang mag guide sa ako, maghatag ug knowledge ug wisdom.
