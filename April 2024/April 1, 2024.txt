1 Samuel 3, John 7, Acts 24, Proverbs 1


RHEMA: 1 Samuel 3:21
The Lord continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word.


C: Proverbs 1:23 NIV
Repent at my rebuke! Then I will pour out my thoughts to you, I will make known to you my teachings.


P: John 7:38-39 NIV
Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them.” By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.


W: Proverbs 1:22 NIV
“How long will you who are simple love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?


REFLECTION:
The Lord will only reveal Himself thru His Word. I can experience in my secret place. Dapat seryosohon nako ang akong secret place. Dapat naay revelation everytime na mag adto ko sa secret place. Dili ko mag duha duha, dili ko mag huna huna ug mga negative. Mo adto ko sa akong secret place because I love God!
