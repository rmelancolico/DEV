1 Samuel 13, John 17, Matthew 6, Proverbs 20


RHEMA: Matthew 6:30-33 NIV
If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith? So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.



C: Matthew 6:25 NIV
“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?


W: Matthew 6:1 NIV
“Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.



REFLECTION:
Dili jd ko angayan na mag problema sa akong mga basic needs. Dili basic needs ang need nako, kunda ang mga spiritual needs. Basic will only follow once unahan nako ang akong God's given purpose. Everything will be provided by God. I will work hard sa akong evangelism. Atleast 2 duha ka tao ang akong ma evangelize, tapos e PIC dayon nako within the week
