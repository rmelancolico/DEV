1 Samuel 12, John 16, Matthew 5, Proverbs 17


RHEMA: Matthew 5:14-16 NIV
â€œYou are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.



C:  1 Samuel 12:24 
But be sure to fear the Lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you.


P: John 16:24 NIV
Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.


W: 1 Samuel 12:15 
But if you do not obey the Lord, and if you rebel against his commands, his hand will be against you, as it was against your ancestors.


REFLECTION:
I am the light of the world, and God wants me to shine. Dili ko mag tambay! mag evangelize ko
