Isaiah 55, Exodus 5, Revelation 18, Acts 15


M: Isaiah 55:2 GNT
Why spend money on what does not satisfy? Why spend your wages and still be hungry? Listen to me and do what I say, and you will enjoy the best food of all.


P: Isaiah 55:3 GNT
“Listen now, my people, and come to me; come to me, and you will have life! I will make a lasting covenant with you and give you the blessings I promised to David.


W: Acts 15:28-29 GNT
The Holy Spirit and we have agreed not to put any other burden on you besides these necessary rules:  eat no food that has been offered to idols; eat no blood; eat no animal that has been strangled; and keep yourselves from sexual immorality. You will do well if you take care not to do these things. With our best wishes.”


A: I will use my money wisely. I will invest it with the right people. Money is nothing if it is not spend on the glory in God. I will be satisfied in the presence of God. God promises me, and I will obey
