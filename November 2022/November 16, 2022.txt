M: Exodus 4:11-12 GNT

P: Isaiah 54:10 GNT

They strengthened the believers and encouraged them to remain true to the faith. “We must pass through many troubles to enter the Kingdom of God,” they taught.



A: Dili diay ko angayan na mag duha duha sa pag share during PIC or other gathering. God has given me mouth to speak, God will provide me with words to speak. God will expand my my boundaries in all my sides: financial and ministry. For this to happen i need to do:

1. Make my living area larger - increase my prayer time even more
2. strengthen ropes - reinforce my knowledge and wisdom of the Word of God
3. strengthen pegs - reinforce my foundation and faith.
