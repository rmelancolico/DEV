Isaiah 63, Exodus 13, Matthew 4, Acts 23


M: Isaiah 63:8-10 GNT
The Lord said, “They are my people; they will not deceive me.” And so he saved them from all their suffering. It was not an angel, but the Lord himself who saved them. In his love and compassion he rescued them. He had always taken care of them in the past, but they rebelled against him and made his holy spirit sad. So the Lord became their enemy and fought against them.


C: Exodus 13:1-2 GNT
The Lord said to Moses, “Dedicate all the first-born males to me, for every first-born male Israelite and every first-born male animal belongs to me.”


P: Isaiah 63:14 GNT
As cattle are led into a fertile valley, so the Lord gave his people rest. He led his people and brought honor to his name.


W: Matthew 4:7 GNT
Jesus answered, “But the scripture also says, ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”


A: God has always been taking care of me. From the foods that I eat, the clothes I wear. I will acknowledge always God in everything. I will not make the Holy Spirit sad: I will be careful on the thing i am going to do, spent more time with the Holy Spirit
