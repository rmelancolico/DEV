M: Acts 16:25-26 GNT
About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. Suddenly there was a violent earthquake, which shook the prison to its foundations. At once all the doors opened, and the chains fell off all the prisoners.



C: Exodus 6:6 GNT

P: Acts 16:31 GNT

W: Isaiah 56:10-11 GNT
He says, “All the leaders, who are supposed to warn my people, are blind! They know nothing. They are like watch dogs that don't bark—they only lie around and dream. How they love to sleep! They are like greedy dogs that never get enough. These leaders have no understanding. They each do as they please and seek their own advantage.



A: I am called to be a good leader, a leader of leaders. And as a leader i should not be in prison. I must free myself, through deep prayer and intimate worship with the Holy Spirit.
