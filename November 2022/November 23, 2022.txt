Isaiah 60, Exodus 10, Matthew 1, Acts 20


M: Exodus 10:1-2 GNT
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go and see the king. I have made him and his officials stubborn, in order that I may perform these miracles among them and in order that you may be able to tell your children and grandchildren how I made fools of the Egyptians when I performed the miracles. All of you will know that I am the Lord.”



C: Acts 20:28 GNT
So keep watch over yourselves and over all the flock which the Holy Spirit has placed in your care. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he made his own through the blood of his Son.



P: Isaiah 60:22 GNT
Even your smallest and humblest family Will become as great as a powerful nation. When the right time comes, I will make this happen quickly. I am the Lord!”



W: Acts 20:29-31 GNT
I know that after I leave, fierce wolves will come among you, and they will not spare the flock. The time will come when some men from your own group will tell lies to lead the believers away after them. Watch, then, and remember that with many tears, day and night, I taught every one of you for three years.



A: My situation right now, will be a powerful testimony to all. I will be more than a conqueror to all my trails. To do this I must:

1. Strengthen my foundation so that i will be unshakable.
2. Obedience to God's command - like Moses and Aaron did, i will continue to obey God's command.
