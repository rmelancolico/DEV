Isaiah 65, Exodus 15, Matthew 6, Acts 25


M: Isaiah 65:1 GNT
The Lord said, “I was ready to answer my people's prayers, but they did not pray. I was ready for them to find me, but they did not even try. The nation did not pray to me, even though I was always ready to answer, ‘Here I am; I will help you.’



C: Matthew 6:1 GNT
“Make certain you do not perform your religious duties in public so that people will see what you do. If you do these things publicly, you will not have any reward from your Father in heaven.



P: Isaiah 65:8-9 GNT
The Lord says, “No one destroys good grapes; instead, they make wine with them. Neither will I destroy all my people—I will save those who serve me. I will bless the Israelites who belong to the tribe of Judah, and their descendants will possess my land of mountains. My chosen people, who serve me, will live there.



W: Isaiah 65:12-13 GNT
It will be your fate to die a violent death, because you did not answer when I called you or listen when I spoke. You chose to disobey me and do evil. And so I tell you that those who worship and obey me will have plenty to eat and drink, but you will be hungry and thirsty. They will be happy, but you will be disgraced.



A: I will be effective in helping others back to God. To do this, will:

1. Make new friends with the intention of sharing Jesus.
2. Improve my invitation skills.
3. Obey my leaders, no more reasons.
