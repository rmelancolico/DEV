Daniel 13, Deuteronomy 30, John 13, Hebrews 10


RHEMA: Deuteronomy 30:19 NIV
This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live



C & P: Deut 30:16 NIV
For I command you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in obedience to him, and to keep his commands, decrees and laws; then you will live and increase, and the Lord your God will bless you in the land you are entering to possess.




W: Hebrews 10:26-27 NIV
If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.



REFLECTION:
My correct choice will not only good for me but also for my children. I will choose to follow and obey God. And I will show to my children that I obey God, so that they will also obey God. Blessing will be only given to those who are obedient. To obey all not just a few.
