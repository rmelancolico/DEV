Hosea 12, Joshua 7, Matthew 9, 1 Peter 3

RHEMA: Matthew 9:36-38 NIV
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.”

C: 1 Peter 3:7
Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.


W: Matthew 9:16-17 NIV
“No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse. Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.”

REFLECTION:
Persistent in praying for an harvester. I will keep on praying for the Lord of harvest to sent workers for harvest. Bahala unsa ka dugay ko mag pray, I will keep on praying. I will intensify my prayer for my List of 12. I will pray for them one by one, listing their lives to God and applying the Blood of Jesus over them
