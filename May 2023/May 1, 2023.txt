Ezekiel 48, Deuteronomy 17, John 1, Titus 2


RHEMA: Titus 2:6-8 NIV
Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.



C: Deuteronomy 17:10 NIV
You must act according to the decisions they give you at the place the Lord will choose. Be careful to do everything they instruct you to do.




P: John 1:12-13 NIV
Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God.



REFLECTION:
To teach what I act. As a leader, dapat mag lead ko through example. Dapat mapakita nako sa ginapaconnect ni Lord sa ako kung unsaon ang pag kinabuhi kauban si Jesus.

1. My disciple should see that I am doing the basic life style, labi na ang devo
2. Dapat intentional jd ko na mag consolidate para dali ra ang pag tudlo ug consolidation
3. Mag declare ko always ug blessing. Dapat mag sugod sa ako ang pag declare ug blessings. 
4. always ikanabuhi ang life verse: Matthew 5:16
