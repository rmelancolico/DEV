Daniel 3, Deuteronomy 20, John 4, Hebrews 1


RHEMA: Deuteronomy 20:3-4 NIV
He shall say: “Hear, Israel: Today you are going into battle against your enemies. Do not be fainthearted or afraid; do not panic or be terrified by them. For the Lord your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory.”



C: John 4:34-35 NIV
“My food,” said Jesus, “is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. Don’t you have a saying, ‘It’s still four months until harvest’? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.


REFLECTION
i am currently facing battle, battle of doubt, battle slumber, battle of negative thinking. Dili ko mag pa pildi sa akong battle karon. Dili ko mag duha duha sa pag  consolidate, dili ko mag una una ug negative thoughts. I was commanded to harvest. I will intensify my PIC, for victory is mine
