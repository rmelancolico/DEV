Hosea 2, Deuteronomy 31, John 14, Hebrews 11

RHEMA: Hebrews 11:6 NIV
And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.



C: John 14:12 NIV
Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.



P: Deuteronomy 31:8 NIV
The Lord himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.”


REFLECTION:
By Faith. Tanan nako buhaton dapat by faith. Even though naay trouble sa unahan, pero by faith magpadayon ko. By faith kabalo ko na mahimaya ang Ginoo. Ipakita nako sa uban ang akong faithfulness sa Ginoo. I will share what my faith has brought me.
