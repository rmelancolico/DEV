Hosea 10, Joshua 5, Matthew 7, 1 Peter 1


RHEMA: Matthew 7:3-5 NIV
“Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.

P: Matthew 7:7-8 NIV
“Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.


W: Matthew 7:26-27 NIV
But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.”



REFLECTION:
For me to  become an effective in making disciple, I need to be a effective disciple first. I cant bring others to dawn prayer if can't bring myself first to dawn prayer. I need to act as a leader first before I can develop others to become a leader.
