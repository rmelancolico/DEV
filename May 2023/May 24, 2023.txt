REFLECTION:
I have power over satan. I will practice that authority in all aspect in my life. To be effective in using this power:


1. have faith and don't doubt - my authority will multiple many times when i have faith and dont doubt.
2. More heavenly wisdom and knowledge - the scripture will be my weapon.
