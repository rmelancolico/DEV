RHEMA: Daniel 10:18-19 NIV
Again the one who looked like a man touched me and gave me strength. “Do not be afraid, you who are highly esteemed,” he said. “Peace! Be strong now; be strong.” When he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, “Speak, my lord, since you have given me strength.”



C: Deuteronomy 27:9-10 NIV

Then Moses and the Levitical priests said to all Israel, “Be silent, Israel, and listen! You have now become the people of the Lord your God. Obey the Lord your God and follow his commands and decrees that I give you today.”



P: Daniel 10:12 NIV
Then he continued, “Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them.




REFLECTION:
I am not weak! I am strong. Dili ko basta2x ma huyang. Kay dili pd basta2x ang naghatag sa ako ug kusog, si God. With that, I will be strong in doing my God given purpose. My strenght was given to be so that I will obey God's command without a failure. Since God has given me strength it is right that I should listen to Him. To clearly hear the voice of God, I will deepen my communion with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit will be my guide, my translator!.
