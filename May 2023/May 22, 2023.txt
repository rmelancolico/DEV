REFLECTION:
Nakuha ni Joshua ang iyang anointing tungod sa iyang leader. After kang Moses, Joshua lead the Israelites into many victories. Joshua always listened to Moses. Para ma lead nako ang akong mga disciple into many victories: 

1. mag listen ko always sa akong leader. Dapat naka focus ang akong ears when my leaders is saying something
2. always have a positive mindset once mag ingon ang akong leader na mag conquest or mag go
3. be more transparent sa akong leader
