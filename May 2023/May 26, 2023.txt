Hosea 9, Joshua 4, Matthew 6, James 5

RHEMA: Joshua 5:7-8 NIV
Be patient, then, brothers and sisters, until the Lord’s coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains. You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord’s coming is near.



C: Matthew 6:1 NIV
“Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.


P: Matthew 6:6 NIV
But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.


W: Matthew 6:19-20 NIV
“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.



REFLECTION:
I will be patient like a farmer before the harvest. Dugay nako cgig tanum para sa akong disciples. Pero dapat diay tas.an nako ang akong patient like a farmer. Ug dapat while waiting for an harvest, i need to do something sa akong gitanum. Like a farmer, need nako butangan ug fertilizer ang akong mga tanum. If naay insect need nako mag spray.

Fertilzer => this will be my obedience to the God's command. Obedient na mag go, mag P.I.C.
Insecticide => this will be my intentional prayer for my list of 12. applying the right chemical, which is the Blood of Jesus
