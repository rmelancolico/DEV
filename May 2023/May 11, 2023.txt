REFLECTION:
Maturity in my faith. Dapat mature nako mag hunahuna with regards sa mga bulahaton sa Ginoo. Ang bata, pero lng kalilapay, dula, enjoyment ang nasa huna huna. Pero dili naman ko bata, matured naman ko, dapat ang akong ginahuna huna karon is ang work sa Ginoo. I will reflect on the things that i have done, and from there I will do everything with faith, not in doubt and ready myself for troubles to come.
