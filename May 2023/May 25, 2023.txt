REFLECTION:
My covenant with the Lord is to do His bidding which is making disciple, raising up leaders of leader. But i have not yet done this before (effectively), it is still new to me. I am still at the consolidation stage. And for me to be successfull in making disciple and raising them up to raise leaders i will let the Holy Spirit walk ahead me. Leading me everystep of the process. I wont be an effective discipler, if my disciples will not see me being lead by the Holy Spirit. Great things will happen when I am being lead by the Holy Spirit
