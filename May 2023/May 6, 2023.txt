REFLECTION:
God will always test me. Testing in life will always be present in my life. Naa koy mga experience sa una na mga cross road sa akong life. Naay mga life changing decision na himoon. Some of those roads i took was a mistake. Those roads that i shouldnt take, but still God was gracious, He realign my road back to Him. With that i learn a lesson. During cross roads: 

1. I need to have a deeper knowledge and wisdom - this can come only when i am close with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is my guide. I will level up my relationship with the Holy Spirit
2. Check your priorities - before going on which road you take, have a checklist of your priorities. Check which road that will lead you to Matthew 6:33. The road should be align to your God given purpose
3. It should be narrow - dont go for the easy road. Take the road that will increase your dependent to God
