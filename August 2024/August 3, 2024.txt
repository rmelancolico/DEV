RHEMA: Luke 7:18-19 NIV
John’s disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, he sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?”



C: Luke 7:50 NIV

W: Acts 27:11 NIV
But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship.


REFLECTION:
In Luke 7:18-19, it seems that John is having a second thoughts about Jesus, that he even send his disciple to ask Jesus if He is the one who is to come. I realize two things in this passage.

1. John was not always with Jesus
  - we need to always be at the presence of Jesus to experience supernatural. Bisan unsa ka pa ka busy sa imong life, be it in ministry or career, always ka dapat dool kang Jesus

2. The need of testimony.
 - you need to have not just one testimony but many testimony, to testify the glory of God in your life. Because of your testimony many will be assure and will believe in Jesus
