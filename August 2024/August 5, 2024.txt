REFLECTION:
To experience the glory of God dapat fully awake ka. Kung fully awake ka, always ka ready, wala ka ga tanga, you are doing something


1. Spiritually awake
 - dapat dili ga luya ang imong spiritual ug naka engage ka sa spiritual battle

2. mentally awake
 - always ka ready to share the Word, naa ka baon always

3. physically awake
 - no to procrastination, ga believe and go, run the race with fire and with urgency
