Ezekiel 3 (Numbers 9, Mark 3, Ephesians 2)


RHEMA: Ezekiel 3:4-6 GNT
Then God said, “Mortal man, go to the people of Israel and say to them whatever I tell you to say. I am not sending you to a nation that speaks a difficult foreign language, but to the Israelites. If I sent you to great nations that spoke difficult languages you didn't understand, they would listen to you.



P: Ezekiel 3:9 GNT
I will make you as firm as a rock, as hard as a diamond; don't be afraid of those rebels.”



W: Ezekiel 3:18 GNT
If I announce that someone evil is going to die but you do not warn him to change his ways so that he can save his life, he will die, still a sinner, but I will hold you responsible for his death.



REFLECTION

Sometimes, i feel doubt to my prospect or the people that God gives me. Sometimes i say to myself, "makasabot kaha ni siya"? But this i want doubt, but have faith on God. God will give my the ability to speak, and for them the ability to understand. Some will not listen, thats part of the experience, but surely some will listen and respond will.
