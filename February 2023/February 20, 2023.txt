Ezekiel 7, Numbers 12, Mark 6, Ephesians 4


RHEMA: Mark 6:50-52 GNT

They were all terrified when they saw him. Jesus spoke to them at once, “Courage!” he said. “It is I. Don't be afraid!” Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind died down. The disciples were completely amazed, because they had not understood the real meaning of the feeding of the five thousand; their minds could not grasp it.


P: Mark 6:56 GNT
And everywhere Jesus went, to villages, towns, or farms, people would take their sick to the marketplaces and beg him to let the sick at least touch the edge of his cloak. And all who touched it were made well.



REFLECTION:
Even though there are time that i would not understand the ways of God, but i will not lower my belief. But I will increase my faith. I wont stop doing things that will touch the heart of God.
