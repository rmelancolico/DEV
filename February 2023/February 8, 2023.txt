Lamentations 4, Numbers 5, Matthew 27, Galatians 4


RHEMA: Galatians 4:1-3 GNT
But now to continue—the son who will receive his father's property is treated just like a slave while he is young, even though he really owns everything. While he is young, there are men who take care of him and manage his affairs until the time set by his father. In the same way, we too were slaves of the ruling spirits of the universe before we reached spiritual maturity.

P:Galatians 4:7 GNT
So then, you are no longer a slave but a child. And since you are his child, God will give you all that he has for his children.

REFLECTION:
I will follow my leader. I know that God has sent him to manage me, to help me grow. I will be more transparent to him. To be eager to learn from him.
