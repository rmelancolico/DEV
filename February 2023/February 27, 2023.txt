Ezekiel 13, Numbers 18, Mark 12, Philippians 4


RHEMA: Mark 12:43-44 GNT
He called his disciples together and said to them, “I tell you that this poor widow put more in the offering box than all the others. For the others put in what they had to spare of their riches; but she, poor as she is, put in all she had—she gave all she had to live on.”



C: Mark 12:17 GNT
So Jesus said, “Well, then, pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and pay to God what belongs to God.” And they were amazed at Jesus.


REFLECTION:
I will not give the Lord salin-salin only. I will always give my 20% or more on my everything. Bahala gamay lng bilin sa ako. God first!
