Ezekiel 11, Numbers 16, Mark 10, Philippians 2

RHEMA: Philippians 2:1-4 GNT
Your life in Christ makes you strong, and his love comforts you. You have fellowship with the Spirit, and you have kindness and compassion for one another. I urge you, then, to make me completely happy by having the same thoughts, sharing the same love, and being one in soul and mind. Don't do anything from selfish ambition or from a cheap desire to boast, but be humble toward one another, always considering others better than yourselves. And look out for one another's interests, not just your own.

P: Ezekiel 11:18-19 GNT
When they return, they are to get rid of all the filthy, disgusting idols they find. I will give them a new heart and a new mind. I will take away their stubborn heart of stone and will give them an obedient heart.


REFLECTION:
In Christ I am made strong, In Christ I learn true love. I will work hard on my work not for just my own needs, but always the needs of other, my family,my disciples. I will be more humble, I will acknowledge that my worths is only in Jesus and doing my God given purpose.
