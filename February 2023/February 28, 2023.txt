Ezekiel 14, Numbers 19, Mark 13, [Colossians 1]

RHEMA: Mark 13:33-34 GNT
Be on watch, be alert, for you do not know when the time will come. It will be like a man who goes away from home on a trip and leaves his servants in charge, after giving to each one his own work to do and after telling the doorkeeper to keep watch.



W: Mark 13:21-23 GNT

“Then, if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or, ‘Look, there he is!’—do not believe it. For false Messiahs and false prophets will appear. They will perform miracles and wonders in order to deceive even God's chosen people, if possible. Be on your guard! I have told you everything ahead of time.



REFLECTION:
God has entrusted me with people to take good care, to help grow their spirituality. I will give it all my best.
1. I will always be aware of the condition of my disciples
2. keep track on their progress, not just spiritual but also all aspects
3. always ask wisdom from the Holy Spirit
