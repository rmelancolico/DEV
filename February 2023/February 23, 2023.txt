Ezekiel 10, Numbers 15, Mark 9, Philippians 1


RHEMA: Philippians 1:9-10 GNT
I pray that your love will keep on growing more and more, together with true knowledge and perfect judgment, so that you will be able to choose what is best. Then you will be free from all impurity and blame on the Day of Christ.


C: Philippians 1:27 GNT
Now, the important thing is that your way of life should be as the gospel of Christ requires, so that, whether or not I am able to go and see you, I will hear that you are standing firm with one common purpose and that with only one desire you are fighting together for the faith of the gospel.



REFLECTION
To grow more in love in all aspect. I will grow in love towards my wife, I will show more love both verbal and in action. I will give more love to my list of 12 by being more intentional to them.
