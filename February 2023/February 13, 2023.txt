Ezekiel 1, Numbers 7, Mark 1, Galatians 6


RHEMA: Mark 1:15 GNT
“The right time has come,” he said, “and the Kingdom of God is near! Turn away from your sins and believe the Good News!”



C: Galatians 6:9-10 GNT
So let us not become tired of doing good; for if we do not give up, the time will come when we will reap the harvest. So then, as often as we have the chance, we should do good to everyone, and especially to those who belong to our family in the faith.



REFLECTION:

The time has come for me to really do my God given purpose:

1. I will be more intentional on my consolidation.
2. I will not allow my negative thoughts conquer me in helping others
3. I will believe in myself, that I could do anything in Christ
