Ezekiel 2, Numbers 8, Mark 2, Ephesians 1


RHEMA: Mark 2:27-28 GNT
And Jesus concluded, “The Sabbath was made for the good of human beings; they were not made for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”



C: Ezekiel 2:6-7 GNT
“But you, mortal man, must not be afraid of them or of anything they say. They will defy and despise you; it will be like living among scorpions. Still, don't be afraid of those rebels or of anything they say. You will tell them whatever I tell you to say, whether they listen or not. Remember what rebels they are.



REFLECTION:
My Lord is the lord of everything in me. Thus I will honor Him in everything that I have.
