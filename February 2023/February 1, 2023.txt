Jeremiah 50, Leviticus 26, Matthew 21, 2 Corinthians 11


M: Matthew 21:28-30 GNT
“Now, what do you think? There was once a man who had two sons. He went to the older one and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’ ‘I don't want to,’ he answered, but later he changed his mind and went. Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. ‘Yes, sir,’ he answered, but he did not go.



P: Leviticus 26:3-5 GNT
“If you live according to my laws and obey my commands, I will send you rain at the right time, so that the land will produce crops and the trees will bear fruit. Your crops will be so plentiful that you will still be harvesting grain when it is time to pick grapes, and you will still be picking grapes when it is time to plant grain. You will have all that you want to eat, and you can live in safety in your land.



W: Matthew 21:18-19 GNT
On his way back to the city early next morning, Jesus was hungry. He saw a fig tree by the side of the road and went to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. So he said to the tree, “You will never again bear fruit!” At once the fig tree dried up.



A: I have made a choice to follow Jesus. I made a commitment to obey Him. I will not allow it to be just words, i will do what i have said. I will go and be a soul winner.
