Lamentations 1, Numbers 2, Matthew 24, Galatians 1


RHEMA: Matthew 24:42-44 GNT
Watch out, then, because you do not know what day your Lord will come. If the owner of a house knew the time when the thief would come, you can be sure that he would stay awake and not let the thief break into his house. So then, you also must always be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you are not expecting him.



REFLECTION:
I will do my best, that i will see to it that what I have harvested will last.
