Lamentations 5, Numbers 6, Matthew 28, Galatians 5


RHEMA: Galatians 5:1 GNT
Freedom is what we have—Christ has set us free! Stand, then, as free people, and do not allow yourselves to become slaves again.



C:Matthew 28:18-20 GNT
Jesus drew near and said to them, “I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth. Go, then, to all peoples everywhere and make them my disciples: baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And I will be with you always, to the end of the age.”




REFLECTION:
I am free! I will do everything so that i will keep this freedom, I dont want to be  a slave again. As freed by Jesus, I will follow Jesus and obey.
