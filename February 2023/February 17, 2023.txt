Ezekiel 5, Numbers 10, Mark 4 [Ephesians 3]


RHEMA: Mark 4:8 GNT
But some seeds fell in good soil, and the plants sprouted, grew, and bore grain: some had thirty grains, others sixty, and others one hundred.”

Mark 4:26-27 GNT
Jesus went on to say, “The Kingdom of God is like this. A man scatters seed in his field. He sleeps at night, is up and about during the day, and all the while the seeds are sprouting and growing. Yet he does not know how it happens.



W: Mark 4:24 GNT
He also said to them, “Pay attention to what you hear! The same rules you use to judge others will be used by God to judge you—but with even greater severity.



REFLECTION:

I will not discourage to a person that i sowed if they dont bear fruits. What i will happens, I will continue to sow. With faith that this seed will bear more than hundreds.
