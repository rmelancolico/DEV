REFLECTION:
During the time of Jesus, it was easy for the disciples to obey them. It because of this reasons:
1. The know Jesus. They have a first hand experience with Jesus
2. They have faith and ask Jesus to increase their faith
3. They leave everything.

For me to effortlessly obey God, I need to:
1. Go deeper with my relationship with God.
2. Let my faith walk
3. Trust everything to God.
