Isaiah 41, 1 Corinthians 5,  Acts 12, Proverbs 1

Isaiaha 41:9
I took you from the ends of the earth,
    from its farthest corners I called you.
I said, ‘You are my servant’;
    I have chosen you and have not rejected you.


Acts 12:24 NIV
But the word of God continued to spread and flourish.

- called to serve, and to serve with excellence i will do
- It was God Himself who choses me, therefore, i will not fail



Command + Warning: 1 Corinthians  5:6-7 NIV

Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough? Get rid of the old yeast, so that you may be a new unleavened batch—as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.
