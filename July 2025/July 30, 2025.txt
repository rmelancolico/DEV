Isaiah 45, 1 Corinthians 8, Acts 15, Proverbs 30


1 Corinthians 8:8-10 NIV
But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do. Be careful, however, that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak. For if someone with a weak conscience sees you, with all your knowledge, eating in an idol’s temple, won’t that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols?


i will be careful on what i will be eating. making sure that no weak in conscience sees me. All food has been cleanse by the Blood of Jesus
