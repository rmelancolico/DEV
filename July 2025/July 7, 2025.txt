Isaiah 43, [1 Corinthians 7,  Acts 14, Proverbs 7]

Isaiah 43:1-2
But now, this is what the Lord says—
    he who created you, Jacob,
    he who formed you, Israel:
“Do not fear, for I have redeemed you;
    I have summoned you by name; you are mine.
When you pass through the waters,
    I will be with you;
and when you pass through the rivers,
    they will not sweep over you.
When you walk through the fire,
    you will not be burned;
    the flames will not set you ablaze.


i will not fear what trials i will be. I will keep on going, doing my purpose.
I will exert more excellent effort. Intentionally invite and pray
