RHEMA: Psalms 23:1-3 NLT
The Lord is my shepherd; I have all that I need. He lets me rest in green meadows; he leads me beside peaceful streams. He renews my strength. He guides me along right paths, bringing honor to his name.

- as long my shepherd is the Lord, He will provide all my needs. He will lead me to the place of abundance. He will lead me to place a peace and He will renew my strength. Where I go, I will bring honor to His Name.
To Remain in God's Flock
1.) Listen and obey His voice
2.) Stay with your spiritual family (flocks)
3.) Help the lost flocks return to God's flock


COMMAND: Luke 10:3 NLT

PROMISE: Psalms 23:4 NLT
Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid, for you are close beside me. Your rod and your staff protect and comfort me.
