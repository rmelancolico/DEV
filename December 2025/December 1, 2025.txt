Psalms 16-17, Luke 5, [Acts 15], Proverbs 1


RHEMA: Luke 5:4-5 NLT
When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Now go out where it is deeper, and let down your nets to catch some fish.” “Master,” Simon replied, “we worked hard all last night and didn’t catch a thing. But if you say so, I’ll let the nets down again.”

For a better, bountiful catch!
1. Go deeper with communion of the Holy Spirit - the deeper the communion, the bigger the catch
2. Worked hard is not enough, obedience is required - in obedience your hard work will not be wasted
3. Consistent Discipline is a must - 


COMMAND: Luke 5:10b NLT
Jesus replied to Simon, “Don’t be afraid! From now on you’ll be fishing for people!”




PROMISE: Psalms 16:6 NLT
