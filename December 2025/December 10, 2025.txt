RHEMA: Psalms 27:4 NLT
The one thing I ask of the Lord— the thing I seek most— is to live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, delighting in the Lord’s perfections and meditating in his Temple.
- This is my desire. This will be what my heart will desires in my life. To stay in His presence. To be saturated with His fire. I will go deeper with my communion with the Holy Spirit. I will meditate more on His Word.


COMMAND: Psalms 27:14 NLT
Wait patiently for the Lord. Be brave and courageous. Yes, wait patiently for the Lord.



PROMISE: Psalms 27:13 NLT
Yet I am confident I will see the Lord’s goodness while I am here in the land of the living.
- Amen!
