Ezekiel 47, Deuteronomy 16, Luke 24, Titus 1


RHEMA: Ezekiel 47:12 NIV
Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing.”




P: Luke 24:48-NIV

You are witnesses of these things. I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”



W: Luke 24:25 NIV
He said to them, “How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken!




REFLECTION:
I will bear fruits not just for a seaon, but every month. I will win new soul every month! TO do this:

1. I will make sure that i am in the river bank. what is this river bank? my community of believer.
2. my secret place is my river. Dapat dako ang akong secret place
3. absorb nourishment from the Holy Spirit
