Ezekiel 45, Deuteronomy 14, Luke 22, 2 Timothy 3


RHEMA: Luke 22:10-13 NIV

He replied, “As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters, and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’ He will show you a large room upstairs, all furnished. Make preparations there.” They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.


C: Luke 22:40 NIV

On reaching the place, he said to them, “Pray that you will not fall into temptation.”




REFLECTION:
God's promise on my life is only achievable ways of obidients. Ma experience lng nako ang gina ingon ni Lord sa akong life kung mag go lng jd ko. Like sa disiple when they prepare for the past over. Na experience nila ang gina ingon ni Jesus sa ila, kay nag go man sila.
