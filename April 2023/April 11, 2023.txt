Ezekiel 37, Deuteronomy 6, [Luke 19, 2 Timothy 1]


RHEMA: Deuteronomy 6:1-2 NIV

These are the commands, decrees and laws the Lord your God directed me to teach you to observe in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess, so that you, your children and their children after them may fear the Lord your God as long as you live by keeping all his decrees and commands that I give you, and so that you may enjoy long life.



C: Deuteronomy 6:3 NIV
Hear, Israel, and be careful to obey so that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, promised you.


P: Ezekiel 37:14 NIV
I will put my Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I the Lord have spoken, and I have done it, declares the Lord.’”



REFLECTION:
As a father I have the responsibility to show to my childern what are the commands of God.

1. I will show them how to obey the commands
2. I will talk about the commands
3. I will encourage them by telling the rewards.
