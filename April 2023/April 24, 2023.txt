Ezekiel 43, Deuteronomy 12, [Luke 21, 2 Timothy 2]


RHEMA: Deuteronomy 12:8-10 NIV

You are not to do as we do here today, everyone doing as they see fit, since you have not yet reached the resting place and the inheritance the Lord your God is giving you. But you will cross the Jordan and settle in the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, and he will give you rest from all your enemies around you so that you will live in safety.



C: Deuteronomy 12:5 NIV
But you are to seek the place the Lord your God will choose from among all your tribes to put his Name there for his dwelling. To that place you must go;






REFLECTION
I will not do as I please. I will do my God given purpose. To go and make disciple. My prosperity was delay because my go is delayed.
