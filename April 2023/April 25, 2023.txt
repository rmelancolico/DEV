RHEMA: Ezekiel 44:5 NIV
The Lord said to me, “Son of man, look carefully, listen closely and give attention to everything I tell you concerning all the regulations and instructions regarding the temple of the Lord. Give attention to the entrance to the temple and all the exits of the sanctuary.




C: 2 Timothy 2:2 NIV
You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.




REFLECTION:
full obedience start from being keen listener to God's command. I need to really listen closely to all the instruction that will be given to me and I will do it!
