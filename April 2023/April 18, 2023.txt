Ezekiel 41, Deuteronomy 10, Luke 19, [2 Timothy 1]


RHEMA: Luke 19:1-4 NIV
Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy. He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because he was short he could not see over the crowd. So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.



P: Luke 19:16-17 NIV

“The first one came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned ten more.’ “‘Well done, my good servant!’ his master replied. ‘Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.’



RELFECTION:
What ever my situation, what ever i will have. I will always seek God!
