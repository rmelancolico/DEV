Psalms 2, Mark 12, Acts 7, Proverbs 19


RHEMA: Mark 12:33 NLT
And I know it is important to love Him with all my heart and all my understanding and all my strength, and to love my neighbor as myself. This is more important than to offer all of the burnt offerings and sacrifices required in the law.”

To love Him is to give it to Him everything. I will surrender everything to Him, my desire, my aspiration and my time. 

Showing my love to Him is for me to:

1. all my thoughts should be on His agenda
2. my time and effort should be done to finish His mission
3. to increase compassion for the lost


COMMAND: Psalms 2:11 NLT
Serve the Lord with reverent fear, and rejoice with trembling.


WARNING: Mark 12:24 NLT
