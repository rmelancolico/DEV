- The spirit of a spectators. 
  I am called by Jesus not just to be a spectators or just an audince impact, but i am called to finish His works
How to remove the spirit of a spectators
1. Engage - ill do my part, i will not be idle. work work work
2. stay away from wrong circle - be in the right circle, stay with those who are not spectators
3. focus on God's work and not on once self's - when Peter started to focus on himself(warming himself, with the wrong persons), he keep his eyes away from Jesus, he started to drift away, answer questions the wrong way
