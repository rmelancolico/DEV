RHEMA: Acts 10:38 NIV
how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.

-The power is with the Holy Spirit. My Sharpness will depend on my communion with the Holy Spirit. 
The deeper my communion with the Holy Spirit the sharper I am
The sharp i am, the more disciples


PROMISE: Psalms 5:12 NIV
Surely, Lord, you bless the righteous; you surround them with your favor as with a shield.
