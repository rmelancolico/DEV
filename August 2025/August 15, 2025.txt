2 Corinthians  7:1 NIV
Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.

* The promise of God requires a pure heart, that results in holiness. God is holy and He requires a holy person to dwell in, to work with for His glory

 Remove all that contaminates the:
  1. Body - eat healthy, groom properly, schedule for an excercise (every sunday afternoon)
  2. Spirit - apply the Blood of Jesus that no evil thoughts will enter. Think of a productive thoughts

PROMISE: Isaiah 59:21 NIV
