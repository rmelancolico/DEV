1 Corinthians  13:2 NIV
If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.

* To do everything with love. It is by the love of God that i have been redeemed, therefore i will do my God-given purpose with love.
  - to seed with love
  - to serve with love
  - to submit with love
With love, or by loving my God-given purpose i will not easily get tired. I will not easily complain. There will always smile on my face. To continue and go deeper with: Loving People, Loving God

COMMAND: Acts 20:28 NIV
