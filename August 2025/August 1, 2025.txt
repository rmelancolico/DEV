Isaiah 47, 1 Corinthians 10, Acts 17, Proverbs 1


1 Corinthians 10:31-33 NIV
So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God— even as I try to please everyone in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.


- I will be mindful on the things that i will do, i should evaluate it if it will give glory to God.
- i will sacrifice some of time, resources so that many will be saved


WARNING: Proverbs 1:22 NIV
“How long will you who are simple love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?
