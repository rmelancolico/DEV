Isaiah 52, 1 Corinthians 15, Acts 22, Proverbs 7


1 Corinthians 15:10 NIV
But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.

* It was by His grace that made me what i am today. By His grace i was given the privilege to serve Him. By His grace, i was given opportunity to become a better version of myself everyday.

- I will work harder with my God-given purpose
- His grace will be seen in my life 


PROMISE: 1 Corinthians 15:2 NIV
By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.
