Jeremiah 12, Philippians 2, Acts 21, Proverbs 13


RHEMA: Philippians 2:14-16 NIV
Do everything without grumbling or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, “children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.” Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.

*To shine before others, you need to display a full obedient without grumbling. To shine, you need to be blameless and pure. Who you are, or what state you are, it will reflect what kind of light you are going to shine. The purer you are, the brighter your shine is.
1. Full obedient, not partial
2. on time obedient, not delayed
3. heart check, whats in your heart when you obey matters

COMMAND: Philippians 2:3-4 NIV
Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.

PROMISE: Proverbs 13:11 NIV
Dishonest money dwindles away, but whoever gathers money little by little makes it grow.


WARNING: Proverbs 13:18 NIV
Whoever disregards discipline comes to poverty and shame, but whoever heeds correction is honored.
