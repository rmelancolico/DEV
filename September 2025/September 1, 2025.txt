Jeremiah 2, Galatians 4, Acts 11, Proverbs 1

RHEMA: Acts 11:24 NIV
He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.

How to effectively bring the lost back to the Lord

1. Be a good man - goodness should manifest in your life. Be an example. "...Let your shine before other, so that they will see your good deeds, and praise your father in heaven..." - Matthew 5:16
2. Full of the Holy Spirit - be overflowed with the presence of the Holy Spirit. The more presence of Holy Spirit you have, the more you can give. You can ignite others in to fire
3. Faith - believing on things yet to come. Believe on the multitude to come. And since multitude will come, you need to be prepared
