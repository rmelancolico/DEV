Ezekiel 26, Numbers 31, Luke 9, 2 Thessalonians 2


RHEMA: Luke 9:58 GNT
Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lie down and rest.”

Luke 9:62 GNT
Jesus said to him, “Anyone who starts to plow and then keeps looking back is of no use for the Kingdom of God.”



REFLECTION:
I have decided to follow the way of Jesus. I will not complain, I will not be burden, no more excuses. No turning back. Past is past, i will not look back on the comfort that I have before. But instead I will look forward to the work to be done, and the harvest to do.
