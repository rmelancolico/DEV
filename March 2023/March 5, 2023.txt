Ezekiel 19, Numbers 24, Luke 2, 1 Thessalonians 1

RHEMA: GNT 1 Thessalonians 1:3
For we remember before our God and Father how you put your faith into practice, how your love made you work so hard, and how your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ is firm.


REFLECTION:
My faith will be a testimony to all, it will encourage many people

1. I will continue to work on my testimony
2. I will ask wisdom from the Holy Spirit to make my testimony effective
3. Allow God to give me more experience to build up my testimony
