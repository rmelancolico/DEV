RHEMA: Luke 4:14-15 GNT
Then Jesus returned to Galilee, and the power of the Holy Spirit was with him. The news about him spread throughout all that territory. He taught in the synagogues and was praised by everyone.

Luke 4:32 GNT
They were all amazed at the way he taught, because he spoke with authority.



C: Luke 4:43 GNT
But he said to them, “I must preach the Good News about the Kingdom of God in other towns also, because that is what God sent me to do.”




REFLECTION:
I will be sharing the Good News of God with power and authority. To do this I need:

1. To have heavenly wisdom
2. Guidance of the Holy Spirit
3. Spend alot of time in the presence of God
