Ezekiel 34, Deuteronomy 3, Luke 17, 1 Timothy 6

RHEMA: GNT Luke 17:9-10
The servant does not deserve thanks for obeying orders, does he?  It is the same with you; when you have done all you have been told to do, say, ‘We are ordinary servants; we have only done our duty.’”

C: GNT Deuteronomy 3:28
Give Joshua his instructions. Strengthen his determination, because he will lead the people across to occupy the land that you see.’


W: GNT Ezekiel 34:3
You drink the milk, wear clothes made from the wool, and kill and eat the finest sheep. But you never tend the sheep.

REFLECTION: 
What i do is what have been expected into me. Every victory that i have expierence  and the rewards that cames with it is not for my glory, but to glorify my God
