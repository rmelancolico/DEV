Ezekiel 30, Numbers 35, Luke 13, 1 Timothy 3


RHEMA: Luke 13:7-9 GNT
So he said to his gardener, ‘Look, for three years I have been coming here looking for figs on this fig tree, and I haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it go on using up the soil?’ But the gardener answered, ‘Leave it alone, sir, just one more year; I will dig around it and put in some fertilizer. Then if the tree bears figs next year, so much the better; if not, then you can have it cut down.’”



C: Numbers 35:34 GNT
Do not defile the land where you are living, because I am the Lord and I live among the people of Israel.”

2. Fertilization - i will filterize with the Word of God
3. Give it time - never give up, keep on working hard. Trust the process
