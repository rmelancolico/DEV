Ezekiel 31, Numbers 36, Luke 14, 1 Timothy 4


RHEMA: 1 Timothy 4:6-8 GNT
If you give these instructions to the believers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, as you feed yourself spiritually on the words of faith and of the true teaching which you have followed. But keep away from those godless legends, which are not worth telling. Keep yourself in training for a godly life. Physical exercise has some value, but spiritual exercise is valuable in every way, because it promises life both for the present and for the future.


C: Luke 14:23 GNT
So the master said to the servant, ‘Go out to the country roads and lanes and make people come in, so that my house will be full.



REFLECTION:
I will not entertain godless legends. I will train more with my spirituality.
1. Study more of the scripture
2. Listen carefully to my leader, taking notes always
3. Develop self learning skill
