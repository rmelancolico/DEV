Ezekiel 22, Numbers 27, Luke 5, 1 Thessalonians 4


RHEMA: Luke 5:4-6 GNT
When he finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Push the boat out further to the deep water, and you and your partners let down your nets for a catch.” “Master,” Simon answered, “we worked hard all night long and caught nothing. But if you say so, I will let down the nets.” They let them down and caught such a large number of fish that the nets were about to break.



C: 1 Thessalonians 4:18 GNT
So then, encourage one another with these words.



REFLECTION:
I keep on pushing my boat further. my boat is my secret place. Bahala kapoy na, kung wala man koy catch, padayon lng dyapun ko. Maka catch ra lagi ko, aslong as naa rako sa presence ni Lord
