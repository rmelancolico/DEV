Ezekiel 18, Numbers 23, Luke 1, Colossians 4

RHEMA: Numbers 23:20 GNT
I have been instructed to bless, And when God blesses, I cannot call it back.


C:  Colossians 4:5-6 GNT
Be wise in the way you act toward those who are not believers, making good use of every opportunity you have. Your speech should always be pleasant and interesting, and you should know how to give the right answer to everyone.


W: Luke 1:20 GNT
But you have not believed my message, which will come true at the right time. Because you have not believed, you will be unable to speak; you will remain silent until the day my promise to you comes true.”



REFLECTION:
It is my part of my God given purpose to bless.
1. I will work hard to produce wealth so that I could bless people
2. I will be faithful to the principle of financial increase (The x0.2 on everything)
