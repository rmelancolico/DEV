Ezekiel 17, Numbers 22, Mark 16, Colossians 3


RHEMA: Colossians 3:1-3 GNT
You have been raised to life with Christ, so set your hearts on the things that are in heaven, where Christ sits on his throne at the right side of God. Keep your minds fixed on things there, not on things here on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.



C: Colossians 3:12 GNT
You are the people of God; he loved you and chose you for his own. So then, you must clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.



P: Colossians 3:23-24 GNT
Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as though you were working for the Lord and not for people. Remember that the Lord will give you as a reward what he has kept for his people. For Christ is the real Master you serve.



REFLECTION:
I will work hard not for the worldly things. I will set my heart to God's heart desire.

1. I need to have a clear vision on my purpose on life
2. I pray that I will see what God sees.
3. My worldly being is not my priorities
