Ezekiel 35, Deuteronomy 4, Luke 18, [2 Timothy 1] 

RHEMA: GNT Luke 18:40-42
So Jesus stopped and ordered the blind man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,  “What do you want me to do for you?” “Sir,” he answered, “I want to see again.” Jesus said to him, “Then see! Your faith has made you well.”


C: GNT Deuteronomy 4:9-10
Be on your guard! Make certain that you do not forget, as long as you live, what you have seen with your own eyes. Tell your children and your grandchildren  about the day you stood in the presence of the Lord your God at Mount Sinai, when he said to me, ‘Assemble the people. I want them to hear what I have to say, so that they will learn to obey me as long as they live and so that they will teach their children to do the same.’



REFLECTION:
Like the blind man, i will not stop calling to God until God does something to me and to my family
