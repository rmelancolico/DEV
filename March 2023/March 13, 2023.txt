Ezekiel 25, Numbers 30, Luke 8, 2 Thessalonians 1


RHEMA: Luke 8:50 GNT
But Jesus heard it and said to Jairus, “Don't be afraid; only believe, and she will be well.”



W: Numbers 30:2 GNT
When a man makes a vow to give something to the Lord or takes an oath to abstain from something, he must not break his promise, but must do everything that he said he would.



REFLECTION:
I will not be afraid, I will believe, my wife and my new daugther will be well. THank Jesus.
