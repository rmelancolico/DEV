Ezekiel 20, Numbers 25, Luke 3, 1 Thessalonians 2


RHEMA: 1 Thessalonians 2:4 GNT
Instead, we always speak as God wants us to, because he has judged us worthy to be entrusted with the Good News. We do not try to please people, but to please God, who tests our motives. 



REFLECTION:

God entrusted me to speak His Good News. I will speak it wisdom from the Holy Spirit. I will speak not to please anyone else, but i will speak as obedience to my God Given Purpose.
