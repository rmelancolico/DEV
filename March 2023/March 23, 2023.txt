Ezekiel 33, Deuteronomy 2, Luke 16, [1 Timothy 6]


RHEMA: Ezekiel 33:7-9 GNT
“Now, mortal man, I am making you a lookout for the nation of Israel. You must pass on to them the warnings I give you. If I announce that an evil person is going to die but you do not warn him to change his ways so that he can save his life, then he will die, still a sinner, and I will hold you responsible for his death. If you do warn an evil person and he doesn't stop sinning, he will die, still a sinner, but your life will be spared.”

W: Luke 16:10-12 GNT
Whoever is faithful in small matters will be faithful in large ones; whoever is dishonest in small matters will be dishonest in large ones. If, then, you have not been faithful in handling worldly wealth, how can you be trusted with true wealth? And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to someone else, who will give you what belongs to you?



REFLECTION:
I was pointed by God to be an look out. To warn people. It is also my job to be blameless, therefore i will work hard to warn people

1. I will need to be more intentional in doing my God given purpose
2. I need to increase my compassion
3. I need not to be scared
