Ezekiel 24, Numbers 29, Luke 7, 1 Thessalonians 5


RHEMA: Luke 7:27 GNT

For John is the one of whom the scripture says: ‘God said, I will send my messenger ahead of you to open the way for you.’



C:  1 Thessalonians 5:8 GNT
But we belong to the day, and we should be sober. We must wear faith and love as a breastplate, and our hope of salvation as a helmet.

How happy are those who have no doubts about me!”




REFLECTION:
Lord guide me, open my eyes. I know that you will send someone to open ways, to help me in my journey as i make disciples for Your name.
