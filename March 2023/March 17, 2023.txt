Ezekiel 28, Numbers 33, Luke 11, 1 Timothy 1


RHEMA: Luke 11:34-36 GNT
Your eyes are like a lamp for the body. When your eyes are sound, your whole body is full of light; but when your eyes are no good, your whole body will be in darkness. Make certain, then, that the light in you is not darkness. If your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, it will be bright all over, as when a lamp shines on you with its brightness.”


P: Luke 11:28 GNT
But Jesus answered, “Rather, how happy are those who hear the word of God and obey it!”
