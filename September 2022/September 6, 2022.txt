Everyone who lives ought to be wise; it is as good as receiving an inheritance  and will give you as much security as money can. Wisdom keeps you safe—this is the advantage of knowledge.

W:  GNT Proverbs 6:9-11
How long is the lazy man going to lie around? When is he ever going to get up?  “I'll just take a short nap,” he says; “I'll fold my hands and rest a while.”  But while he sleeps, poverty will attack him like an armed robber.
