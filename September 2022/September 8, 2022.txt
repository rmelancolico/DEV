Ecclesiastes 9, Psalm 139, Proverbs 8, 2 Thessalonians 3

M: GNT Ecclesiastes 9:11
I realized another thing, that in this world fast runners do not always win the races, and the brave do not always win the battles. The wise do not always earn a living, intelligent people do not always get rich, and capable people do not always rise to high positions. Bad luck happens to everyone.


C: GNT 2 Thessalonians 3:13
But you, friends, must not become tired of doing good.

P: GNT 2 Thessalonians 3:3
But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen you and keep you safe from the Evil One.

W: GNT 2 Thessalonians 3:10
While we were with you, we used to tell you, “Whoever refuses to work is not allowed to eat.”

A: i will maybe fail on of the test, but i will not give up! I will continue on doing what is good and right, which is making disciple
