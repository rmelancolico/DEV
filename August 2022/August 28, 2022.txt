M: Psalm 128:1 GNT
Happy are those who obey the Lord, who live by His commands.


C: Colossians 1:23 GNT
You must, of course, continue faithful on a firm and sure foundation, and must not allow yourselves to be shaken from the hope you gained when you heard the gospel. It is of this gospel that I, Paul, became a servantâ€”this gospel which has been preached to everybody in the world.


P: Psalm 128:2-4 GNT
Your work will provide for your needs; you will be happy and prosperous. Your wife will be like a fruitful vine in your home, and your children will be like young olive trees around your table. A man who obeys the Lord will surely be blessed like this.


W: Proverbs 28:20 GNT
Honest people will lead a full, happy life. But if you are in a hurry to get rich, you are going to be punished.


A: true happiness is found in obedience. I will obey God's command
