Job 38, Psalm 126, Proverbs 26, Philippians 3


M: Philippians 3:12-14 GNT

I do not claim that I have already succeeded or have already become perfect. I keep striving to win the prize for which Christ Jesus has already won me to himself. Of course, my friends, I really do not think that I have already won it; the one thing I do, however, is to forget what is behind me and do my best to reach what is ahead. So I run straight toward the goal in order to win the prize, which is God's call through Christ Jesus to the life above.


C: Philippians 3:17 GNT
Keep on imitating me, my friends. Pay attention to those who follow the right example that we have set for you.


P: Psalm 126:6 GNT
Those who wept as they went out carrying the seed will come back singing for joy, as they bring in the harvest.


W: Proverbs 26:16 GNT
A lazy person will think he is smarter than seven men who can give good reasons for their opinions.



A: I will continue to striving to win the price that God has prepared for me.
