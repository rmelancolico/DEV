Job 42, Psalm 130, Proverbs 30, Colossians 3


M: GNT Psalm 130:5-6
I wait eagerly for the Lord's help, and in his word I trust. I wait for the Lord more eagerly than sentries wait for the dawnâ€” than sentries wait for the dawn.

C: GNT Colossians 3:1-2
You have been raised to life with Christ, so set your hearts on the things that are in heaven, where Christ sits on his throne at the right side of God.  Keep your minds fixed on things there, not on things here on earth.

P: GNT Colossians 3:24
Remember that the Lord will give you as a reward what he has kept for his people. For Christ is the real Master you serve.

W: GNT Colossians 3:5-6
You must put to death, then, the earthly desires at work in you, such as sexual immorality, indecency, lust, evil passions, and greed (for greed is a form of idolatry).  Because of such things God's anger will come upon those who do not obey him.

A: i will wait eagerly for the promise of God and i will do my part while waiting. Make my wait stronger my wisdom wider
