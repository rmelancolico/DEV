Job 16, Psalm 110, Proverbs 2, 2 Corinthians 6


M: Psalm 110:1-3 GNT
The Lord said to my lord, “Sit here at my right side until I put your enemies under your feet.” From Zion the Lord will extend your royal power. “Rule over your enemies,” he says. On the day you fight your enemies, your people will volunteer. Like the dew of early morning your young men will come to you on the sacred hills.


C: 2 Corinthians 6:17 GNT
 And so the Lord says,
“You must leave them
    and separate yourselves from them.
Have nothing to do with what is unclean,
    and I will accept you.


P: 2 Corinthians 6:1-2 GNT
In our work together with God, then, we beg you who have received God's grace not to let it be wasted. Hear what God says:

“When the time came for me to show you favor,
    I heard you;
when the day arrived for me to save you,
    I helped you.”

Listen! This is the hour to receive God's favor; today is the day to be saved!


W: 2 Corinthians 6:14 GNT
Do not try to work together as equals with unbelievers, for it cannot be done. How can right and wrong be partners? How can light and darkness live together?


A: i have my network with me in this battle, i am not alone, i will work hard for God's kingdom.
