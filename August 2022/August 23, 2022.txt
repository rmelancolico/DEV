Job 35, Psalm 123, Proverbs 23, Ephesians 6


M: Job 35:9-11 GNT
When people are oppressed, they groan; they cry for someone to save them. But they don't turn to God, their Creator, who gives them hope in their darkest hours. They don't turn to God, who makes us wise, wiser than any animal or bird.


C: Ephesians 6:1 GNT
Children, it is your Christian duty to obey your parents, for this is the right thing to do.


Ephesians 6:4 GNT
Parents, do not treat your children in such a way as to make them angry. Instead, raise them with Christian discipline and instruction.


P: Job 35:14 GNT
Job, you say you can't see God; but wait patiently—your case is before him.


W: Proverbs 23:4-:5 GNT

A: I will always cryout to my God, to Him alone
