REFLECTION:
I will believe. and part of believing if obeying. Dili matawag na ga too ka tapos walay kay obedience

obey in:

1. tithes and offering - mahimo na consistent ani
2. making disciples - in every PIC dapat naay jd Word of God. Dapat maka diskarte ko na ma insert nko ang Word of God sa discussion
	            - Dapat mag invite pa ko more!
