Genesis 12, Proverbs 10, John 5


RHEMA: John 5:44 NIV
How can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?


REFLECTION:
i will seek the glory that comes from God. dapat maging sensitive ko sa presense sa Ginoo. Mag palalom ko always. I need to be faithful sa dawn prayer, noon prayer ug prayer mountains
