Genesis 13, Proverbs 11, John 6


RHEMA: John 6:26-27 NIV
Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.”



P: Genesis 13:17 NIV
Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.”



W: Proverbs 11:2 NIV
When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom.



REFLECTION:
God wants me to live not just by merely surviving. I need to thrives. I will work with excellent not just in my carreer but also in my ministry. I will remove distraction. I will work my ministry not because of the miracles but because of grace.
