Genesis 14, Proverbs 16, John 7


RHEMA: John 7:15-16 NIV
The Jews there were amazed and asked, “How did this man get such learning without having been taught?” Jesus answered, “My teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me.


W: John 7:17-18 NIV
Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own. Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him.



REFLECTION:
I should not rely on my own understanding. I should always ask the Holy Spirit to speak through me to use me. And I will always recognize that I speak the gospel not for my own glory but to glorify God. The miracle works of God should be magnify in my life so that anyone who see this will praise and worship God
