Genesis 9, Proverbs 2, John 2


RHEMA: Proverbs 2:1-8 NIV
My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you, turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understandingâ€” indeed, if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding, and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure, then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God. For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. He holds success in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless, for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones.




REFLECTION:
God wants me to search for wisdom. One of the reason ngano tamaron ko mag basa ug books, because sometimes maglisod ko ug sabot. Na realize nako na command ni Lord na mag search ug wisdom. Para ma succesful ko sa pag basa sa mga books, dapat e desire nako na maka store up ug wisdom. The fear of the Lord will start from your understanding sa iyang mga commands.
