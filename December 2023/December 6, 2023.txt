Genesis 29, Proverbs 6, John 19


RHEMA: Genesis 29:14-35 - Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel
  

C:Proverbs 6:20-21 NIV
My son, keep your father’s command and do not forsake your mother’s teaching. Bind them always on your heart; fasten them around your neck.



W: Proverbs 6:9-11 NIV

How long will you lie there, you sluggard? When will you get up from your sleep? A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest— and poverty will come on you like a thief and scarcity like an armed man.



REFLECTION:
Jacob wanted to marry Rachel, but instead he got Leah. He was disappointed that he got Leah. He work again another 7 years just to get Rachel. Then when he got Rachel, Leah was forsaken by Jacob. Jacob love Rachel more than Leah. But is with Leah that Jacob bare fruit first. I realize that sometimes, the person that we want to be disciple is not yet given to us. We still need to work hard to get them. But, God will give us another disciple (Leah). It is very important that we do not forsake our Leah [Arniel]. I will also focus to kuya Arniel, I will give time for PIC, to get to know him even more
